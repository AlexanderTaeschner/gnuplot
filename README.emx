EMXVGA is another terminal type for OS/2, which runs on the PM of OS/2
as well as in full screen mode on DOS running on 386 or better PC.
The driver is compiled using EMX GCC with VESA and SVGAKIT which supports
VESA, Trident, Cirrus, ET4000, WD and S3, and is maintained by
Johannes Martin (JMARTIN@GOOFY.ZDV.UNI-MAINZ.DE), with additions of
putting string at an arbitrary angle by David J. Liu (liu@phri.nyu.edu).

"
The file gstring.c contains the display string function for SVGAKIT of emx GCC.
The function, g_string (x,y,color,angle,*string), displays the string at (x,y)
which is the upper left corner of the string, in color at an arbitrary angle.
To install, copy gstring.c to SVGAKIT directory and update the files graph.h
and makefile with references to g_string(...), gstring.c and gstring.o.
"

To install, add -lgraph -lvesa as linker parameters and enable EMXVGA
in term.h


To use with DOS, it is necessary to do emxbind -a gnuplot.exe -acim.
