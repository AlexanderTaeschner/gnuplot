GNUPLOT is a command-driven interactive function plotting program.  It
is case sensitive (commands and function names written in lowercase
are not the same as those written in CAPS).  All command names may be
abbreviated, as long as the abbreviation is not ambiguous.  Any number
of commands may appear on a line, separated by semicolons (;).
