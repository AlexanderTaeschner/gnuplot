 To install:

 - Under Unix, use configure and make
 
 - Under DOS, if you are using bash and DJGPP,
   you can just run djconfig.sh

 - Other platforms, copy the relevant makefile from config/
   to src, cd to src and make. Some makefiles have not yet
   been updated to the new directory structure.
