This is a check list I go through when preparing a release.
Many of the items are here because I messed up on a particular release
and added a check to avoid making the same mistake again.
Of course there may remain things that could go wrong even if
all these checks are made.

Release packaging
=================

- check current date and copyright dates in
	docs/titlepag.tex docs/title-ja.tex
	src/version.c
	RELEASE_NOTES
- for a minor release, make sure that the list of new features, changes,
  and bug fixes from NEWS are also reported in RELEASE_NOTES.

- update FAQ.pdf and place a copy in the top level directory
- make src/makefile.all

- change PATCHLEVEL
- check version string in src/version.c       should be "6.0" not "6.0.3"
- check patchlevel in src/version.c           should be "3" not "6.0.3"
- also AC_INIT and VERSION_MAJOR at the head of configure.ac
- also in RELEASE_NOTES
- modify gnuplot.doc to point to latest release notes
- confirm that RELEASE=1 in config/mingw/Makefile
- use latest version of autotools so the the generated configure script is up to date
- ./prepare
- ./configure       (needed for next step, but specific configuration is not relevant)

- make distcheck    (local checks and build)

Staging
=======

- rename tarball to something like gnuplot-6.0.3-testing.tar.gz
- upload this to the "testing" folder on SourceForge together with
  a readme file that explains any specific points that might be
  important and planned release timeline.
- notify the gnuplot-beta mailing list and request feedback on success/failure
  of the testing tarball on other platforms (MacOS, Windows, M4, ...).
- Wait for feedback 
	- if everything seems good, use the original tarball for release
	- if not, either fix the problem and prepare a new tarball
          or warn that this is a known issue in the Release Notes

Release
=======
- create a new release directory on SourceForge
	- depending on confidence level, set the directory to "staging"
	  so that you have 3 days to get it right before it goes public
	- upload release tarball, user manual, release notes, and readme

- make ReleaseNotes.html  (uses txt2html)
  cp ReleaseNotes.html ReleaseNotes_6_0_3.html
  Update News and Release Notes on web site

- Update web site docs 
	FAQ gnuplot_6.pdf gnuplot-ja.pdf html

- Notify  newsgroup, developer list, LWN

- Other gnuplot developers may upload platform-specific binaries built from
  the source tarball.  Check back later to see if the readme file should
  be modified to explain what they are.

Git Tag for minor release
=========================
 git commit <whatever was done to finalize release>
 git push
 git tag -a 6.0.3 -m "Release 6.0.3" HEAD
 git show 6.0.3
 git push origin 6.0.3

After the dust settles (minor release)
======================================
 Bump minor version to next alpha, e.g. 3 -> 4alpha
   in PATCHLEVEL src/version.c configure.ac
 Start next section of NEWS, RELEASE_NOTES

Git branch procedure (major release)
====================================
 git checkout master <where we want to branch from>
 git branch branch-6-2-stable
 git checkout branch-6-2-stable
 git tag -a 6.2 -m "Branch point for 6.2" HEAD
 <edit and commit all relevant files>
 git push -u origin branch-6-2-stable
