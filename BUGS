This is the list of known bugs that remain in the program for lack of
opportunity or knowledge how to solve them.  Please see and use

for an up-to-date bug tracking system.

 *) The hidden line algorithm still is not perfect.  Especially when
    hidden edges would pass very close to visible vertices or edges,
    they can appear to "bleed through".  There is an option to draw
    both sides of the surface in the same linetype, thus avoiding this
    problem to become noticeable.

 *) In the Atari version, windows are not currently supported.  This
    means gnuplot 3.4 will not run with MultiAES.  We hope to correct
    this shortly in gpcontrb.tar.z.
    [Status of this bug: unknown]

 *) Arrows and labels are not clipped (2D and 3D).

 *) (Not really a bug)
    Terminal drivers which are accompanied by external executables
    could cause some trouble: their subprocesses (started by fork() e.g.)
    may inherit handles to open file(s) from the main process.
    If the filesystem doesn't allow deleting open files these file are
    locked for the time the terminal driver is running.

 *) In pcl5 mode, the hpgl driver prints a spurious "DI,1DI,0" string in the
    upper left corner of the plot. 
    [Source code suggests this is solved.  Needs confirmation.]
