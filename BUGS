 1. The hidden line algorithm is not perfect.  We have put in an option
    to draw both sides of the surface in the same linetype, thus avoiding
    this problem completely.  We should put in an option of not drawing
    the back at all.

 2. In the Atari version, windows are not currently supported.  This
    means gnuplot 3.4 will not run with MultiAES.  We hope to correct
    this shortly in gpcontrb.tar.z.
    [Status of this bug: unknown]

 3. autoscale writeback is probably broken.  One problem is that
    the range is written back before the range is extented to a
    whole number of tics. eg  if data is 0.9->10.1, that is what
    gets written back, but the plot is 0 -> 11.  If autoscale
    is switched off, you do get 0.9->10.1 since switching off
    autoscale switches off the extend-to-tic-multiple stuff.

    Also, writeback with log scales writes back the log of the min/max
    [Status: unknown]

 4. m[]tics bug when plotting time data
    There is an initialization problem when plotting time data with an
    interval calculation; an inordinate number of m[]tics are automatically
    drawn, e.g., 

      set xdata time; set ydata time
      set timefmt "%d/%m"
      set format x "%b %d"
      set xrange ["01/12":"06/12"]
      set xtics "01/12", 172800, "05/12"
      plot x

    The problem can be avoided by initializing via a plot before the 
    interval calculation:
      [...]
      set xrange ["01/12":"06/12"]
      plot x
      set xtics "01/12", 172800, "05/12"
      plot x

 5. "\n" does not work in the format for the tics in splot

 6. Error bars don't work in polar plots

 7. arrows and labels are not clipped (2D and 3D)

 9. (Not really a bug)
  Terminal drivers which are accompanied by external executables
  could cause some trouble: their subprocesses (started by fork() e.g.)
  may inherit handles to open file(s) from the main process.
  If the filesystem doesn't allow deleting open files these file are
  locked for the time the terminal driver is running.

11. compiling help file with Visual C++ 4.0/Windows NT
  The help compiler is unable to compile gnuplot.rtf, possibly because
  it cannot handle the new RTF spec. There is no workaround, but
  VC++ 5.0/6.0 users should have no problems.
 
12. The 16bit Windows version, compiled by Borland C++ 3.1, crashes with
  a protection violation in 'all.dem', on the first plot that tries
  to read a datafile. Heap corruption suspected.

14. In pcl5 mode, the hpgl driver prints a spurious "DI,1DI,0" string in the
  upper left corner of the plot.


(Moved from old WhatsNew file, needs cleaning up)

BUGS outstanding
  illegal trailing tab on fig output
  minor tics missing on HPUX ?
  terminal settings get propagated when terminal is changed (now fixed ?)
  set ?range [] writeback is broken for logscales.
  source file copyrights are out of date - what should go on new files ?
  to be documented - ms-windows cannot do wide, dashed lines (well, win32 can,
  but...)
