" Instead of producing a graph, the `table` terminal prints out the points on",
" which a graph would be based, i.e., the results of processing the `plot` or",
" `splot` command, in a multicolumn ASCII table of X Y {Z} R values.  The",
" character R takes on one of three values: \"i\" if the point is in the active",
" range, \"o\" if it is out-of-range, or \"u\" if it is undefined.  The data",
" format is determined by the format of the axis labels (see `set format`).",
"",
" For those times when you want the numbers, you can display them on the", 
" screen or save them to a file.  This can be useful if you want to generate",
" contours and then save them for further use, perhaps for plotting with",
" `plot`;  see `set contour` for an example.  The same method can be used to",
