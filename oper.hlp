The operators in GNUPLOT are the same as the corresponding operators
in the C programming language, except that all operators accept
integer, real, and complex arguments, unless otherwise noted.
The ** operator (exponentiation) is supported, as in FORTRAN.

Parentheses may be used to change order of evaluation.
