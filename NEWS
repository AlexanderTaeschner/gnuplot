  replaced with 'set style data|function|line'. The 'set nolinestyle'
  command, however, is still available for the time being.
* NEW 'system', 'unset' command
* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: all 'set noVariable' commands have been
  replaced with the new 'unset Variable' command.

  the recommendations of The Open Group. When a century is not otherwise
  specified, values in the range 69-99 refer to the twentieth century and
  values in the range 00-68 refer to the twenty-first century.

[3.7.0.8]

  set locale  only affects LC_TIME (for the moment ?)
  make start optional in series tics, ie accept

in 188
  os9 port
  set xrange [] reverse writeback
  allow mix of co-ordinate systems within an arrow/label posn
  initial multiplot support
  - doesn't yet check that terminal is capable, but there is a
    flags field added to the terminal entry to tell gnuplot about this.
    also, suspend() / resume() entry points which are to be called
    between plots of a multiplot.

in 178
   arbitrary length/number of columns in datafile
   accept double/quad-precision fortran numbers (1.23{dDqQ}4)
   - but not in scanf format string
   undefined fit parameters start at 1 rather than 1e-30
   - more chance of convergence / less change of unitary matrix
   WIN32 / Win-NT support
   table output can be read back in for data splot
   - hence gnuplot can be used to dgrid a datafile and write it out
   set missing 'string'
   - nominate a token as standing for missing values in datafile
   - not yet added to documentation
   updates to time-series stuff (so it doesn't break at 2000)
   - except it has become horribly non-portable :-(
   split graph3d.c into util3d.c and hidden3d.c

in 166
   set bar <size>
   - a number rather than just small or large
   allow different linetypes for grid at major and minor tics
   a few more set no* commands for consistency.
   initial go at implementing tic mirrors and axes for splot
   - no ztic axis yet (or no zzeroaxis)
   - tics on axes are not hidden by surface
   attempt to make sin(x) behave as expected when set angle degrees
   - gives answers if x is complex, but I dont know if they are correct
     - acos(cos(x)) seems to give x, so at least its consistent
   - fix a bug which made acos(cos({0,1})) undefined
   new grass.trm

in release 162/164
   set size [{no}square] x,y  - tries to plot with aspect ratio 1
   - seems to work great for postscript
   - please check with your favourite driver
   - uses relative sizes of tics to determine required size.
   posn for key, labels and arrows can be in one of 4 co-ordinate systems
   - first_axes (default)
   - second_axes (for plot..second)
   - graph  (0,0 -> 1,1 = plotting area)
   - screen (0,0 -> 1,1 = whole screen)
   - arrows needn't have endpoints in same co-ords. see help set label
   via is now a required keyword for fit
   - fit f(x) 'file' ... via { 'file' | a,b,... }
   - this is to avoid confusing 'file' with 'using-format-string'
   win32 and 16-bit dos fixes
   - I can compile with tc++, but get an overlay error at runtime.
   new set of documentation programs (I haven't tried them)
   various tweaks to makefile
   changes to pslatex
   - substitute .ps at _last_ . in filename 
   - accept font size of enclosing document as an option.
   - dont forget to close aux file

in release 151

  linux security patch
  can specify font for labels, etc (postscript only ? - I haven't tried this)
  can specify linetype to draw grid / zeroaxes / arrows
  emx terminal driver
  first attempt at pipes for VMS and vector style - needs more work
  l/b/r/t-margin  in place of xmargin - more control over size of margins
  incompatible changes to polar mode:
  - t is now the dummy variable, so x is width of plot as expected
  - tics are not automatically on axes -   set {xy}tics axis nomirror
  - grid is not automatically polar - set grid x [mx] polar [angle]
  - no numbers on grid - they were always in degrees
  second axes
  - x2 and y2 are an independent pair of axes, but they inherit
    ranges from x and y if no second data
    - there can be problems with this, actually - if x2tics are not
      shown, x2range is not autoextended to whole number of tics, so
      same data might not have same range.
  - set x2tics/y2tics/x2label/y2label
  - set [no]log x2 / y2
  - plot [first,] f(x), 'file', ..., second, g(x), ...
  - get specify grid at any/all of x,y,x2,y2
  - see electron.dem
  set border <mask> - 12 bit binary number selects 12 sides of cube around splot
  can specify grid z, to get a grid on back wall of splot
  set mxtics [<interval>|default] | set nomxtics
  - set mxtics  gives auto for logscale, fixed for linear 
  binary, index and every keywords to datafiles.
  - every also works with binary files
  can use '-' as datafile for inline data (ends at line with e)
  can use '' to mean reuse previous file
  splot and fit now use datafile module
  - FIT_SKIP no longer supported - use fit f(x) 'file' every n
  can limit fit range using   fit [variable=min:max] f(variable) ...
  set ticscale <major> [<minor>]
  surface is clipped with no hidden line removal
  - still to do contour and hidden-line surface
  set {x|y|x2|y2} [axis|border] [no]mirror
  - can put tics on border or axes
  - mirror controls mirroring of tics on opposite axis
    - no longer coupled to  set tics out  setiing.
  No longer need to specify parametric mode for 3-column data files.
  ranges automatically extended to whole number of tic intervals
  - doesn't always manage to drop vertical from surface to corner of base
    - workaround is either specify range or use  set border

patchlevel 140
--------------
I've probably missed a lot of features since I'm so used to them.
Plus I never bothered with 3.5 so some of these may have been there.
some of these may have made it into the documentation
Here goes:

  fit f(x) 'file' via ...
  read and plot time data  (timedat.dem)
  set key [top|bottom|under] [left|right|out] [reverse] [box [<linetype>]]
  set key title 'text'
  Processing of escape sequences in "strings" but not 'strings'
  - TeX users in particular advised to use ''
  Multiline labels, etc, using "first\nsecond"
  enhpost driver
  call command (load with parameters)
  x error bars. splines. boxes. [some may have been in 3.5]
  pipes for amiga
  the using patch   plot 'file' using spec:spec:...
  - spec is either column number or (expression in $1, $2, ...)
  new pslatex driver with postscript to aux file.
  set pointsize <scale factor> on some terminals
  doubles in  plot...using  format string - %lf
  unlimited input line length and expression (action) table
  minor tic-marks (like logscale but also for linear)
  - also set grid [mx|my]



that's all I can think of for the moment...
