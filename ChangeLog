2015-08-21  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* docs/doc2tex.c (process_line): Improve passing of hyperlinks to
	pdftex.  Allow both multi-line and single line format, for both
	external and internal hrefs.

2015-08-21  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c (map_position_r):  There is no way to indicate
	"no offset" as opposed to "offset 0", which was causing problems
	if "offset 0" was applied as axis coordinates on a log-scaled axis.
	Now in 2D "offset 0" is interpreted as no offset even for log-scaled
	axes.  3D offsets are still a sore point.
	Bug #1662

	* src/datafile.c src/eval.c src/gp_types.h src/graphics.c sec/plot3d.c
	src/save.c term/svg.trm term/tgif.trm:
	Remove dead code.

2015-08-18  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/parse.c src/parse.h src/plot2d.c src/plot3d.c src/set.c
	src/unset.c demo/iterate.dem docs/gnuplot.doc:
	New special case of iteration in a plot command:
		plot for [i=<start> : *] datafile ...
	This will iterate over all available data without generating an
	error message when the data is exhausted and without generating
	empty plots.  It can be used to iterate over an unknown number of
	columns (e.g. for histograms), an unknown number of data blocks
	(e.g. plot for [i=0:*] datafile index i)  or an unknown number of
	datafiles where the file name is generated from the iteration
	variable.

2015-08-18  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotEvent.cpp src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp:
	Make the error messages from a broken connection to gnuplot_qt less
	alarming.  No change in functionality.  See Bug #1554

	* src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp:  Use fprintf(stderr, ...) instead of
	qDebug() << ... for the inboard driver.  This allows allows Windows
	to catch error messages by the redefinition of fprintf in wtext.h.
	See Bug #1554

2015-08-14  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/dumb.trm src/stdfn.h:  Handle UTF-8 encoding so long as each
	printed glyph occupies only one character cell.  The code is specific
	to UTF-8; i.e. it does not handle other multi-byte encodings.
	Bug #1477

2015-08-12  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (df_generate_pseudodata):  The sampling coordinates 
	generated by pseudofiles '+' and '++' were passed as an ascii string,
	which truncated precision to 6 digits (default for format %g).  Now pass
	in parallel the original (double) value so that no precision is lost.
	Bug #1650

2015-08-08  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/command.c src/command.h src/misc.c src/tables.c
	* docs/gnuplot.doc demo/break_continue.dem:
	New commands `break` and `continue` to short-circuit or terminate
	iteration of a `do` or `while` bracketed clause.

2015-08-07  "Jun T." <takimoto-j@kba.biglobe.ne.jp>

	* term/aquaterm.trm: Failure to save+restore original color was causing
	successive fill areas to become more and more transparent.
	Alsi, make background color pure white.

2015-08-05  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/parse.c (string_or_express): Prevent an empty string variable or
	expression from being interpreted as the magic names '' or "".
	E.g.
	    file1 = 'real-file'
	    file2 = "abc"[3:0]  # any expression that evaluates to ''
	    plot file1,file2    # plots file1 twice, no error message
	Bug #1660

2015-08-03  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/boundary.c src/graphics.c src/graphics.h src/save.c src/save.h
	src/set.c src/setshow.h src/show.c src/unset.c src/tables.c
	docs/gnuplot.doc demo/varcolor.dem:

	Support a separate set of line properties for errorbars.
	New command "set errorbars" is an expansion of "set bars" to include
	line characteristics.  Save errorbars style (previously not saved).
	E.g.   set errorbars lc "black" lw 0.75

	* src/util.c (streq): Avoid buffer underrun on empty string.

2015-08-02 Akira Kakuto <kakuto@fuk.kindai.ac.jp>

	* src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp: Fix #ifdef block syntax, modify
	string concatenation to make it acceptable in VS2010.

2015-08-02  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/Makefile.am (GNUPLOT_QT) [BUILD_QT]: New variable to
	communicate optionally transformed name of gnuplot_qt into main to
	main executable.
	(AM_CPPFLAGS) [BUILD_QT]: Pass GNUPLOT_QT to the preprocessor.
	(clean-demo) [BUILD_QT]: Fix copy-paste-edit oversight.

	* src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp (GNUPLOT_QT): If not defined from
	outside, provide fall-back definition equal to previously
	hardcoded value.
	(execGnuplotQt): Untangle the conditionals a bit. Use new macro
	GNUPLOT_QT for the name of the outboard driver executable (fixes
	SF bug #1652)

	* term/pslatex.trm [!EAM_BOXED_TEXT]: Remove empty fallback
	definition for new entry function.  Remove extraneous optional
	terminal API entry.

2015-08-01  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/command.c (history_command): protect against try_to_get_string
	failure in history commands.

	* src/parse.c (next_iteration): protect against user corrupting
	iteration variable.  E.g. either of these used to segfault
		plot for [n=1:2] x lw n='foo'
		do for [n=1:2] { n="foo" }

	* src/plot2d.c src/plot3d.c src/set.c:  Do not allow function plots
	to specifc an image style (with image/rgbimage/rgbalpha).

	* src/command.c (pause_command):  protect try_to_get_string failure in
	'pause' command.  linux/windows/os2 code fixes are distinct.

	* src/command.c (plot_command splot_command):  Fuzz-testing found
	cases where 'refresh' triggered program failure if there was not an
	active refreshable plot.

	* src/plot3d.c (eval_3dplots): 2015-05-07 code to accommodate images in
	hidden3d plots was being invoked even if hidden3d was not active.

	* src/set.c (set_key): protect against try_to_get_string failure.

	* src/axis.c (get_position_type): Revert recoding of get_position_type
	(2015-02-15). Fixes failure to keep axis setting if already known.
	Bug #1658

	* src/command.c (new_clause {if|else|while|do}_command):
	Better bookkeeping for the depth of nesting in bracketed clauses.

	* src/plot2d.c (eval_plots) src/plot3d.c (eval_3dplots):
	Example of bug:     plot for [i=1:3] T=sprintf("%d",i),i title T
	previous code evaluated the definition three times and only then
	drew [one] plot.   After this fix the code executes define+plot
	three separate times.

	* src/graphics.c (place_parallel_axes): Ignore plots containing no data
	and hence no initialization information for parallel axis structures.
	Example of bug:     plot 'foo' using 1:2:3:4:5 with parallel, 0

	* src/command.c (toggle_command):  Handle plots with no title.

2015-07-31  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	Sync restored repository on SourceForge to in-progress commit tree
	from 2015-07-15.  So far as I can see the only files affected are
	demo/html version updates.

2015-07-15  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (df_determine_matrix_info):  The new (12 May 2015)
	mechanism for tracking matrix and image dimensions transposed the
	row and column counts in the case of
	    plot $asciidata matrix with image
	Bug #1654

	* demo/imageNaN.dem:  Revise the demo to use non-square matrices
	so that it acts as a unit test for errors like the above.

	* demo/html/index.*:  Update version and date

2015-07-15  Tatsuro MATSUOKA  <tmacchant3@yahoo.co.jp>

	* src/eval.c (update_gpval_variables):  Windows variant of linux/posix
	uname() information.  Store in variables
	    GPVAL_MACHINE         e.g. i686, x86_64
	    GPVAL_SYSNAME         e.g. linux, Windows
	    GPVAL_BITS            number of bits in a pointer

	* src/eval.c: Re-order code to support Windows non-C89 compilers
	(e.g. Visual Studio 2010)  (thanks to Akira Kakuto).

2015-07-14  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (df_open):  Bookkeeping for matrix dimensions in plot
	structure must not be applied inside a stats command.

	* src/graphics.c (process_image):  Sanity check that input image data
	does not overflow the space allocated for it based on dimensions 
	calculated when the input file was first opened.

	* src/plot3d.c (eval_3dplots):  Skip empty input file cleanly, as we
	already do for 2D plots.

	* src/datafile.c (df_open):  Filename of the form "+file.dat" must not
	be mistaken for special file '+'.

2015-07-13  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp term/cairo.trm term/wxt.trm:
	Change fixed-length fontname storage to dynamic (cairo + wxt terminals)
	to prevent crashes found by fuzzing.

	* term/hpgl.trm (set_font):  Prevent same crash in hpgl/pcl5 terminal.

	* src/datablock.c:  The storage in a zero-length datablock was not
	initialized.

2015-07-12  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/command.c (bind_command) src/mouse.c (bind_fmt):
	Very old bug (pre v4.0) in parsing the bind command, such that
		bind X" some longish command"
	would corrupt memory.  The output format was bad also.

	Remove ancient files from active repository: lineproc.mac header.mac
	According to Changelog.4 this was done in 2013, but apparently not.

2015-07-11  Christoph Bersch <usenet@bersch.net>

	* term/epslatex.trm:  enable dashtype processing

2015-07-11  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* demo/imageNaN.dem: Fix broken command in demo.

2015-07-11  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/set.c (load_tic_series): Incorrect nesting of brackets caused
	"set xtics 0" to be accepted rather than rejected.  This could lead
	to various bad outcomes (as found by fuzz-testing).

	* src/stats.c: More fuzz-testing.
	Possible double free if string_or_express returns via int_error().

	* src/set.c: More fuzz-testing.  Fix various places where failure to
	parse a string could lead to a double-free

	* src/axis.c (load_range):  More fuzz-testing.  "set [xyz]range"
	per se does not care if the range limits are extremely large,
	e.g.  xrange [ -inf.0 : inf.0 ]
	but other places in the code do not handle this cleanly.
	Limit the range to +/- VERYLARGE

	* src/set.c (set_terminal) src/unset.c (unset_terminal)
	src/eval.c (del_udv_by_name):  More fuzz-testing.
	If GNUTERM is defined but empty, or if a "set term <garbage>" command
	fails during parsing, then the current terminal could be left as NULL.
	Now (I hope) we guarantee that at worst it is "unknown".

	* src/pm3d.c (pm3d_plot): More fuzz-testing.
	If no interpretable pm3d scan lines are found in a file the program
	could die on a divide-by-zero error before noticing the real problem.

	* src/set.c (set_style) src/show.c: "set style func parallelaxes"
	is not supported.  "set style data parallelaxes" was not saved.

2015-07-08  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/estimate.trm:  Initialization of enhanced text string buffer.
	Bug #1648

	* src/set.c src/fit.c src/term.c src/parse.c term/cgm.trm term/gd.trm
	term/x11.trm:  Fuzz-testing found a recurring pattern of fragile code:
	if (isstringvalue(c_token))
	     foo = try_to_get_string();	/* cannot fail */
	Unfortunately it _can_ fail if an expression begins with a quoted string
	but is coerced into returning a numerical value. All of these sites
	require a specific check for (foo != NULL).
	Bug #1649

	* src/eval.c (pop_or_convert_from_string): Some of the cases of bad
	syntax can also be caught inside try_to_get_string() itself. It doesn't
	hurt to add the check at this level also (belt+suspenders approach).
	Bug #1649

2015-07-05  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c (gp_cairo_set_dashtype):  If the dashtype
	is changed then the current path must be stroked and reopened.

2015-07-03  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* configure.ac src/plot2d.h:  Move the definition of SMOOTH_BINS_OPTION
	into plot2d.h, since configure.ac is not seen by the build system on
	MSWin.

	* demo/html/webify.pl:  Default to pngcairo terminal rather than png.

2015-07-02  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graph3d.c:  An incorrect test for variable color was used for
	splots with impulses or points.  Replace it with a shared correct test
	in check3d_for_variable_color.  Note: Binary plots can still set an
	incorrect flag plot->pm3d_color_from_column but this flag is no longer
	sufficient to cause the observed problem.
	Bug #1644

2015-06-28  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* configure.ac: Check for existence of latex2html.
	* docs/Makefile.am (htmldocs/gnuplot.html): Do not try to build if
	latex2html was not found.
	(alldoc): Target 'ms' no longer exists.  Test actual outputs made
	from gnuplot.ms instead.

2015-06-26  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotItems.dpp (drawPoint):
	The "dots" style was inadvertantly made a no-op by change on 2015-02-15.

	* configure.ac demo/bins.dem docs/gnuplot.doc src/gp_types.h
	src/plot2d.c src/interpol.c src/interpol.h demo/random.dem:

	New data filter "bins" sorts the original data into equal width bins
	on x and then plots a single value per bin. The default number of bins
	is controlled by `set samples`, but this can be changed by giving an
	explicit number bins=N in the plot command.  The new feature is marked
	EXPERIMENTAL in the documentation because we may decide to change the
	syntax to "smooth bins" or "filter bins" or something else.

2015-06-23  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/mouse.c (do_event) src/command.c (replotrequest):
	An attempt to zoom or scroll the output from a "test" command could 
	produce useless error messages on the console.  Now it will revert to
	the previous plot command, if any.
	Bug #1627

2015-06-20  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/util.c (gprintf): 'L' had broken if-else since 2010; 'B' was
	missing handling for power zero; 'B' had problem with excess
	precision.

2015-06-15  Daniel J Sebald <daniel.sebald@ieee.org>

	* src/term.c (test_term):  Use of unsigned terminal coordinates could
	cause overflow and jam up display of very small plots in x11 terminal.
	Bug #1626

2015-06-15  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c (plot_boxes):  Autocalculation of box widths was bad
	whenever a NaN data value was encountered.  Now such data points are
	ignored, as they were in version 4.
	Bug #1623

2015-06-14  Daniel J Sebald <daniel.sebald@ieee.org>

	* src/term.c (test_term):  Dashtype sample labels displayed by `test`
	were off by one.

2015-06-05  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/fit.c (fit_command): If there's exactly one more range in a
	'fit' command than there are independent variables, that last
	range has to be applied to the dependent variable
	(a.k.a. "function").

2015-06-04  <pudh4418@users.sf.net>

	* configure.ac:  Qt5 as build for Arch linux apparently requires
	compilation with -fPIC rather than -fPIE.
	Bug #1616

2015-06-03  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/util3d.c (draw3d_line_unconditional polyline3d_next):
	Do not reset line properties for each component line segment in a 
	contour line.  This improves the dash-pattern rendering for contours.
	Bug #1612

	* src/parse.c (add_udv):  Warn if too-long variable name is truncated.
	Bug #1526

2015-06-02  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/show.c:  Clarify the current "set clip" settings in "show clip".

	* src/term_api.h src/graph3d.c:  Send TERM_LAYER_3DPLOT to the terminal
	at the start of an splot.

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.{cpp|h} src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp:
	If the current plot is 3D, do not update the status dispplay of x/y
	coordinates in response to a mouse move event.
	Bug #1605

2015-06-01  Daniel J Sebald <daniel.sebald@ieee.org>

	* src/mouse.c (event_buttonrelease): Improved bookkeeping for which
	icon to display during mouse interaction.
	Bug #1617

	* src/gplt_x11.c (reset_cursor):  Do not reset the cursor of the 
	currently active plot to default just before setting it to the correct
	cursor icon.  Prevents flicker due to transient change of icons.
	Bug #1618

2015-05-31  Jun-ichi Takimoto  <jtakimoto@users.sf.net>

	* src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp:  Mouse coordinates must be passed to the
	clipboard as a QString.
	Bug #1602 (and earlier bugs)

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp (mouseReleaseEvent): With the above
	fix in place, it is not necessary to lock out events during the 
	doubleclick interval.

2015-05-30  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotEvent.cpp src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp:
	Always respond to mouse button release event, even if the graph widget
	is busy or the mouse has left the window area. This prevents the event
	from being lost, causing the rotate-on-mouse-motion mode to get stuck.
	Bug #1602

	* docs/doc2ms.c docs/windows/doc2html.c: Avoid finicky C90 compiler
	warnings.

2015-05-30  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* docs/Makefile.am (noinst_PROGRAMS): Add doc2wxhtml.
	(MOSTLYCLEANFILES, CLEANFILES): Split up into two lists, updated.
	(GNUPLOT_EXE): New variable, points to freshly built gnuplot
	executable.
	($(GNUPLOT_EXE)): Build executable, if not already present.
	(grotxt, grodvi, grops): Turn into proper phony targets: depend on
	the file actually built, do nothing themselves.
	(troff, gnuplot.nroff, gnuplot.txt, gnuplot-groff.dvi)
	(gnuplot-groff.ps): Must depend on titlepag.ms in srcdir, not
	builddir.  Use automatic make variables to simplify. Changed build
	of gnuplot.ms allows to remove complications for out-of-tree
	builds.
	(gnuplot.ms): Call doc2ms with new argument to ease out-of-tree
	builds.
	(gnuplot.tex, pdffigures, figures, nofigures, pdffigures.tex):
	Rules removed. Having different rules produce files of the same
	name, but with different content depending on the order of make
	targets built, cannot possibly work.
	(figures.tex, nofigures.tex): Keep two different versions of
	gnuplot.tex in different-named files.
	(pdf_figures, wxhelp_figures): New targets to handle generation of
	figures for use.
	(gnuplot.tex): Now just a link to (or copy of) nofigures.tex.
	(gnuplot.pdf, nofigures.pdf): Create pdffigures.tex on-the-fly,
	because its content cannot be assumed correct any other way.
	(dvi): Re-enabled.
	(gnuplot.dvi, gnuplot.pdf, nofigures.pdf, gpcard.dvi): Must depend
	on titlepag.tex and toc_entry.sty in srcdir, not builddir.
	(gnuplot.htb): Add necessary dependencies, some of them in srcdir.
	(doc2wxhtml_SOURCES, doc2wxhtml_CPPFLAGS): Use automake to build
	wxhtml, instead of spelling out compile rules ourselfs.

	* configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Up version requirement a bit,
	enable option subdir-objects.

	* docs/doc2ms.c (main, init): Add optional argument giving the
	location of titlepag.ms to be put into the file.  This way the
	file can be processed by roff tools as-is, without having to patch
	it on-the-fly.

2015-05-30  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/js/gnuplot_svg.js:  The test (typeof tspan_element == 'tspan')
	is now failing in multiple browsers.  Comment it out for now.
	Bug #1340

2015-05-22  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/command.c src/command.h src/tables.c docs/gnuplot.doc:
	New command `printerr` works exactly as `print` except that output is
	always to stderr even if normal print output has been redirected using
	`set print`.

2015-05-19  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h:  Update routines that were missed in the
	axis pointer revision.  Remove GET_NUM_OR_TIME (no callers remain).
	Reorganize GET_NUMBER_OR_TIME, get_num_or_time to handle parallel axes.

2015-05-14  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/tek.trm (SIXEL_fillbox): Handle FS_DEFAULT

	* term/tek.trm (SIXEL_make_palette): A second call to make_palette()
	was failed to reset the state, leading to loss of all palette info.
	Now it overwrites any previous palette.
	Bugfix (e.g. heatmaps demo)

2015-05-13  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.*
	term/svg.trm term/js/gnuplot_svg.js docs/gnuplot.doc:
	EXPERIMENTAL support for a variant of hypertext that allows you to pop
	up an image on mouse-over.  The initial implementation looks for a
	hypertext string of the form "image{{xsize},{ysize}}:filename".

2015-05-13  Shigeharu Takeno  <shige@iee.niit.ac.jp>

	* src/command.c (pause_command): The windows "pause" command is
	sensitive to the locale encoding. Keep a translation table to convert
	between gnuplot's idea of the encoding and WIN32 encoding states so that
	strings output by "pause" are not corrupted.
	Bug #1580, Feature Request #415

2015-05-12  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term_api.h src/gadgets.h:  Move definition of struct t_image
	from term_api.h (no terminals use it) to gadgets.h (2D and 3D plots).

	* src/datafile.c src/graphics.c (process_image):  Remove old code that
	tried to empirically determine grid size of an image based on 3D coords.
	Replace it with new bookkeeping in plot->image_properties.{ncols,nrows}
	that is initialized when the image data is read in.
	Bug #1607

2015-05-08  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/contour.c src/graphics.c src/internal.c src/interpol.c
	src/plot3d.c src/save.c src/set.c src/show.c src/tabulate.c:

	* src/graph3d.c src/graph3d.h src/graphics.c src/graphics.h
	src/plot2d.c src/hidden3d.c:
	Replace plot_image_or_update_axes(*plot, TBOOLEAN), which handled
	2 options, with new routine process_image(*plot, t_procimg_action).

	* src/plot3d.c (eval_3dplots):  Accommodate images in hidden3d 
	plots in a way analogous to the current handling of pm3d surfaces.
	A phantom surface is constructed consisting of a single rectangle
	that overlays the image, and that phantom is included as surface
	in the hidden3d sort/divide/occlude processing.

2015-05-05  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/hidden3d.c (build_networks):  In hidden3d mode do not draw
	the surface if the keyword 'nosurface' is present (set the linetype
	internally to LT_NODRAW).  Normally this keyword would mean "draw only
	the data lines, not the isosampled grid lines", but that makes little
	sense for a hidden3d surface.  This provides a way to draw only the
	contours of a hidden3d contour plot.
	See Bug #1603

2015-05-03  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* term/caca.trm: Insert missing include of <sys/select.h>.

	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp: Insert missing include of
	<sys/select.h>.
	(wxt_waitforinput): Add note about missing check for HAVE_SELECT.

2015-05-02  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/Makefile.am (getcolor_x11.o): Use Automake macros to
	control whether tool calls are echoed or not.

	* docs/Makefile.am (LUA_HELP, allterm.h, troff, gnuplot.nroff)
	(grotxt, grodvi, grops, gnuplot.ms, htmldocs/gnuplot.html)
	(pdffigures.tex, figures, nofigures, gnuplot.pdf, gnuplot.tex)
	(gnuplot.dvi, gpcard.dvi, gnuplot.ps, gpcard.ps, gnuplot.hlp)
	(gnuplot.gih, allgih, gnuplot.htb, wxhelp/wgnuplot.html)
	(wxhelp/doc2html.o, wxhelp/doc2html$): Use Automake macros to
	control whether tool calls are echoed or not.
	(gnuplot.texi gnuplot-eldoc.el): Move compilation of ELisp out of
	here.  There was already a separate rule for it.
	(${ELCS}, gnuplot.info, install-info, gnuplot.ipf, gnuplot.rtf)
	(gnuplot.rnh, check-local, clean-local, install-vms): Use Automake
	macros to control whether tool calls are echoed or not.

	* docs/gnuplot.doc: Blank-only line fixed.

2015-04-30  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/hidden3d.c:  If a hidden3d plot included a "with image" component,
	the hidden3d processing was tracking individual pixels as points.  This
	slowed everything down without accomplishing anything useful.  Now we
	ignore image plots altogether in the hidden3d code.

	* demo/hidden2.dem:  Add a demo/test for hidden3d processing of image
	plots.  It doesn't actually work at this point, but is useful as a test
	case for new code.

	* src/axis.c (axis_init) src/axis.h src/plot2d.c:  Funnel existing
	macros AXIS_INIT2D and AXIS_INIT3D into a single routine axis_init().
	Whatever reason there was originally to distinguish the 2D and 3D cases
	is no longer applicable in version 5.

2015-04-29  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.maint docs/pdffigures.tex docs/Makefile.am:
	Try to reduce churn during "make check" "make pdf" etc by removing
	dvi as an auto-generated target and defaulting to documentation with
	figures.

2015-04-27  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graph3d.c (do_3dplot):  Turning on "hidden3d" caused an off by
	one error in assigning color to contours levels.
	Bug #1603

	* src/command.c (do_line):  If an input line starts with a shell escape
	(e.g. '!' for linux) bypass first stage processing (df_tokenise) of the
	remainder of the line.  NB: This means that text following a comment
	character is now passed to the shell rather than being stripped.
	Bug #1517

2015-04-24  Daniel J Sebald <daniel.sebald@ieee.org>

	* src/misc.c (parse_fillstyle):  Additional sanity checks when parsing
	fillstyle options.
	Bug #1597

2015-04-22  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/fit.c:  Fit code really cares about MAX_NUM_VAR, not MAXDATACOLS.

2015-04-22  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (f_stringcolumn f_columnhead df_set_key_title):
	columnhead(FOO) could return strange results for FOO > 999 or
	undefined or otherwise invalid.  Now we extend the range of valid
	column number to 9999 and return 0 for invalid or out of range FOO.
	Bug #1596

2015-04-21  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* configure.ac src/axis.c src/axis.h src/plot2d.c src/set.c src/unset.c:
	Switch to dynamic allocation of parallel axis structures.  The count of
	currently allocated structures is kept in global num_parallel_axes.
	All storage is released by "reset".
	At this stage there still remains a limit on how many parallel axes you
	can use in practice because each one consumes a slot in the `using` 
	specifier (limited by MAXDATACOLS).

2015-04-20  Karl Ratzsch  <ratzsch@uni-freiburg.de>

	* src/term.c (test_term):  Show terminal's native dashtype support in
	the `test` command output.

2015-04-20  Jun Takimoto <takimoto-j@kba.biglobe.ne.jp>.

	* src/mouse.c (apply_zoom):  axis->formatstring and axis->ticfmt are
	now dynamically allocated and must be saved and restored when zooming.

2015-04-18  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h:  axis_defaults[PARALLEL_AXES] no longer needed.

	* src/set.c src/show.c src/unset.c: Clean up a few references to
	PARALLEL_AXES that should instead test for a more restrictive set of
	axes.

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h:  Simplify implementation of axis_name().

2015-04-17  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h: Second stage of moving parallel axis support
	into dynamically allocated storage.  Move the parallel axis structures
	into a separate array and shrink the main axis_array[] accordingly.

	* src/save.c src/set.c src/unset.c:  Split various loops over the full
	set of axes into two separate loops
	    for (axis=0; axis<AXIS_ARRAY_SIZE; axis++) ... axis_array[axis]
	    for (axis=0; axis<num_parallel_axes; axis++) ... parallel_axis[axis]

	* src/unset.c (unset_range reset_command):  Simplify code sections that
	only have to handle the regular axes (not called for parallel axes).
	Add temporary code to handle "reset" of parallel axes; this can go away
	again when "reset" is changed to deallocate the parallel axes altogether.

2015-04-16  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/color.c (set_color):  Some terminals (pdfcairo, post) produced 
	invalid output if given NaN as a gray value in term->set_color().
	Others variously ignored it, replaced it with black, or gray=0.
	Now we trap NaN in the core code and substitute a request for background
	color.  Note:  I'd rather substitute with a fully transparent color,
	but not all terminals handle transparency.
	Bug #1595

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h:  Initial stage of moving parallel axis support
	into dynamically allocated storage.  Here we introduce a new global
	    AXIS *parallel_axis = &axis_array[PARALLEL_AXES]
	For now it points to the existing storage. Later it will become dynamic.

	* src/graphics.c (plot_parallel place_parallel_axes)
	src/set.c (set_paxis) src/show.c (show_paxis):
	Index or point to parallel axis structures relative to parallel_axis[]
	rather than relative to axis_array[].

	* src/plot2d.c (get_data) src/save.c (save_set_all)
	src/unset.c (unset_command):
	Index or point to parallel axis structures relative to parallel_axis[]
	rather than relative to axis_array[].

	* src/unset.c (free_axis_struct):  New routine to free fields in an
	axis structure that is about to be reinitialized or deleted.

2015-04-15  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/show.c (show_paxis): Simplify call to save_prange();
	(show_range, show_link): Call save_prange() instead of deprecated
	save_range().

	* src/save.c (save_range): No longer called. Removed.
	(save_set_all): Replace calls to save_range() by equivalent ones
	to save_prange().

	* src/stdfn.h (FPRINTF, DEBUG_WHERE): Make inactive definitions
	more similar to active ones, for the benefit of people who don't
	like to use {} around their if() bodies.

	* src/save.h: Remove prototype for save_range.

2015-04-15  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c (plot_parallel place_parallel_axes): Revise to use
	axis pointers rather than AXIS_INDEX.

	* src/unset.c: Avoid using AXIS_INDEX where practical.
	Limit initialization of grid/labels/etc to the axes that need it.

	* demo/fit.dem:  Exercise "set fit covariancevariables" in the demo.

	* src/save.c: Avoid using AXIS_INDEX where practical.

2015-04-10  Daniel J Sebald <daniel.sebald@ieee.org>

	* term/tkcanvas.trm:  Fix problems handling an empty font family name
	in a requested font string, as in   set term tkcanvas font ",15"
	Bug #1591

2015-04-09  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/show.c: Revise internal routines to use axis pointers rather
	than AXIS_INDEX.

2015-04-08  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/fit.c (setvarcovar):  Allocated size of string for FIT_COV_*_*
	variables was too small, corrupting the allocation heap.

	* src/fit.c (regress_finalize):  Show results in the log file even if
	the "quiet" option suppresses screen output.

2015-04-07  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term.c (termp_apply_lp_properties):  Fix incorrect assumption
	that dashtype 1 is always solid and already set by default.
	Bug #1588

	* term/emf.trm (EMF_linetype):  Two linetypes (LT_SOLID LT_AXIS) have
	an intrinsic dash pattern.
	Bug #1588

	* src/term.c (test_term):  Use same sequence of setting line properties
	linewidth/linetype/dashtype in the "test" command as in the core code.

	* demo/imageNaN.dem:  Illustrate NaN generated by negative values
	on a log-scale palette mapping.

	* src/set.c src/term.c:  Adjust the new "set mono" option so that 
	"set term xxx mono" is not persistent. I.e., it doesn't leave "set mono"
	in effect after the next terminal change.  This makes it more like the
	version 4 mono terminal option.  "set mono" itself is still persistent.

2015-04-04  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/term_api.h (DEFAULT_MONO_LINETYPES): Empty initializer is
	not allowed.

2015-04-03  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.h (ACTUAL_STORE_WITH_LOG_AND_UPDATE_RANGE):
	If the value being stored to a log-scaled axis is negative, the stored
	value should be NaN rather than the un-logged original value.

	* src/plot2d.c (get_data): But even that doesn't help if UNDEF_ACTION
	re-stores the orginal value, so don't do that.  Together these changes
	fix the problem that negative values mapped onto a log-scaled cbaxis
	produced a valid (but wrong) color rather than being treated as NaN.

2015-04-02  Karl Ratzsch  <ratzsch@uni-freiburg.de>

	* docs/gnuplot.doc:  Document the C library routines used to parse
	numerical constants in commands and expressions. Integer constants are
	read using strtoll(); floating point constants are read using atof().

2015-04-02  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* compile: Add script required by automake.

	* demo/plugin/Makefile.am (demo_plugin_so_SOURCES): Add
	gnuplot_plugin.h.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add plugin.dem.

	* demo/Makefile.am.in (Makefile.am): Subdir 'plugin' has a
	Makefile.am, so it should not be in EXTRA_DIST.

2015-03-29  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/gadgets.c src/gadgets.h src/set.c src/setshow.h src/tables.c
	src/tables.h src/term_api.h src/term.c src/unset.c term/x11.trm
	src/show.c docs/gnuplot.doc:
	New commands
		{un}set monochrome {linetype N <line-properties>}
		set color     (same as "unset mono")
	Maintain a set of monochrome linetypes (all black with varying dot-
	dash pattern and/or width) in parallel with the default set of
	color linetypes.  Switch between the two sets using "set mono" or
	"set color".  Terminal types that used to provide a separate "mono"
	keyword now trigger "set mono" as appropriate.  For example,
	"set term pdf mono" is equivalent to "set term pdf; set mono".
	Six default monochrome linetypes are pre-defined. These do not exactly
	duplicate the idiosynchratic mono linetypes of various pre-version 5
	terminals (be cairo cgm emf fig pdf post ...).
	Some further adjustment for individual terminals may be needed.

2015-03-27  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/save.c src/save.h src.show.c:  Axis pointer conversion of
	save_range, save_tics, save_num_or_time_input.

2015-03-24  Erik Olofsen <olofsen@users.sf.net>

	* term/tek.trm: RGB + palette support for sixel terminal.
	The vt100/vt340 sixel emulator is limited to 16 distinct colors per
	plot but other emulators may permit more.

2015-03-24  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/fig.trm term/epson.trm term/tek.trm:  Remove unused variables.

2015-03-24  <dcb314@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mouse.c src/plot2d.c src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c:
	Incorrect argument type to abs() or fabs().

	* src/stats.c (analyze_sgl_column): Incorrect truncation of double to
	int while calculating absolute deviation.
	Bug #1584

2015-03-24  Tatsuro MATSUOKA  <tmacchant3@yahoo.co.jp>

	* src/command.c (pause_command): Work around a bug seen for 
	mingw + SJIS encoding.

2015-03-23  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/fig.trm:  Preload user-defined linetype colors and gnuplot's
	set of named colors so that they are available in fig plots.

2015-03-22  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/cairo.trm:  The cairolatex terminal should not set the flag
	TERM_ENHANCED_TEXT since latex markup is not the same as gnuplot's
	enhanced text mode.  This does not hurt plotting per se, but it 
	causes the "test" command to emit a non-latex string.

	* src/unset.c: Revise internal routines unset_tics() unset_minitics()
	and unset_range() to use axis pointers rather than AXIS_INDEX.

2015-03-21  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* demo/plugin/.cvsignore: Added.

	* config/cygwin/.cvsignore: Added.

	* config/watcom/.cvsignore: Ignore two more files.

	* docs/Makefile.am (clean-local): $(LUA_HELP) file has to be
	cleaned, too.

2015-03-19  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/boundary.c (do_key_sample) src/graph3d.c src/graphics.c
	src/graphics.h (check_for_variable_color):  The key sample for plots
	with filled objects (boxes, circles, ellipses, etc) and "lc variable"
	was drawn in some non-obvious color not necessarily present in the plot.
	Now we guarantee that the key sample is drawn using the color of the
	first point in the plot.

2015-03-17  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/set.c: Revise many internal routines in set.c to use axis pointers
	rather than AXIS_INDEX.

2015-03-14  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.h src/plot2d.c:  Revise macros AXIS_INIT2D and (the big one)
	ACTUAL_STORE_WITH_LOG_AND_UPDATE_RANGE to use axis pointers rather than
	AXIS_INDEX.  This is mostly invisible to the higher-level code.

	* src/axis.h src/axis.c src/set.c:  Revise load_range() to take axis 
	pointers. Export get_num_or_time().

	* src/axis.h src/axis.c src/plot2d.c src/set.c src/datafile.c:
	Revise add_tic_user() to take axis pointer rather than AXIS_INDEX.

2015-03-13  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h src/datafile.c src/plot2d.c:
	Revise axis_unlog_interval() to use pointers rather than AXIS_INDEX.

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h src/graphics.c:
	Revise old routine axis_revert_range(AXIS_INDEX) to be a wrapper for a
	new routine axis_invert_if_requested(struct axis *).

	* src/axis.c:  Change many call sites to use the new macros and new
	routine variants taking an axis pointer rather than an AXIS_INDEX.
	This set of changes is purely internal to code in axis.c.

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h src/boundary.c src/graphics.c src/mouse.c
	src/plot3d.c:  Revise make_tics(), copy_or_invent_formatstring(), and
	setup_tics() to use axis pointers rather than AXIS_INDEX.

	* src/unset.c: Fix memory leak (linked axis function) on reset.

2015-03-12  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	Begin bottom-up revision of axis handling routines to use pointers
	rather than array indices.

	* src/axis.h: Modify the template for axis tic-generation callbacks from
	  callback(AXIS_INDEX, ...) to callback(struct axis *, ...)
	* src/axis.c (widest_tic_callback): Modify widest_tic_callback to match
	  the new template, although it needs no axis information
	* src/graphics.c (xtick2d_callback ytick2d_callback)
	  src/graph3d.c (xtick_callback ytick_callback ztick_callback):
	  Modify 2D and 3D axis callbacks.
	* src/color.c (cbaxis_callback): Modify color axis callback.
	* src/axis.c (gen_tics): Modify the call sites for all of these.

	Next level up: Modify gen_tics() and all the places that call it.
	old: gen_tics(AXIS_INDEX axis, callback)
	new: gen_tics(struct axis *this, callback)
	
	* src/axis.h src/axis.c (gen_tics):
	* src/boundary.c src/color.c src/graph3d.c src/graphics.c: call sites

2015-03-11  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	Gradually move all axis-related information into the axis structure
	itself rather than leaving it spread out among multiple arrays indexed
	in parallel.  The rationale is to allow routines that process this
	information to operate from a pointer to (struct axis) rather than from
	an array index.  This will allow dynamically allocated axis definitions.

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h src/unset.c:  Part 1 - Keep a copy of the axis
	index (e.g. SECOND_Y_AXIS) in the axis structure.  This may eventually
	go away again, but for now it allows calling a routine that wants the
	axis index from a routine that works from an axis pointer.

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h:  Part 2 - Replace the separate arrays
	timelevel[] and ticstep[] by moving their respective contents into new
	fields axis->timelevel and axis->ticstep.

	* src/axis.c src src/axis.h src/unset.c:  Part 3 - Replace the static
	array ticfmt[AXIS_ARRAY_SIZE][MAX_ID_LEN+1] with a dynamically 
	maintained field axis->ticfmt.

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h:  Part 4 - Reduce length of axisname_tbl[] to
	contain only the axes that use it (i.e. no individual parallel axis
	entries).

	* src/axis.h:  New versions of axis data macros that use axis pointers.
	New macro axis_{un}do_log(struct axis *,value) analogous to
		  AXIS_{UN}DO_LOG(AXIS_INDEX,   vlaue)
	New macro axis_map(struct axis *, variable) analogous to
		  AXIS_MAP(AXIS_INDEX, variable)
	New macro tic_scale(ticlevel, struct axis *) analogous to
		  TIC_SCALE(ticlevel, AXIS_INDEX)

2015-03-08  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c: The code tracking matrix column/row headers tried
	to extract the relevant string from the wrong internal array.
	Bug #1575

2015-03-06 Allin Cottrell  <cottrell@wfu.edu>

	* src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c:  Prevent free() of a string constant.

2015-03-05  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term_api.h src/term.c src/graphics.c term/estimate.trm:
	New routine estimate_plaintext(char *enhancedtext) returns a string
	stripped of all enhanced text markup.  Use this to provide plain
	text titles in output files even though the plot title itself contains
	markup characters.
	Bug #1573

	* demo/hypertext.dem: Simplify output file (attach hypertext to only
	one set of points).

2015-03-02  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/tables.c src/graphics.c (plot_filledcurves) docs/gnuplot.doc:
	The "y1=foo" and "y2=foo" options to the filledcurves style are 
	confusing, as both operate on the current plot's y axis regardless
	of whether it is y1 or y2.  Rename the option as "y=foo" and remove
	mention of the older y1= and y2=.  All three are accepted on input.
	Bug #1568 

2015-02-26  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/fit.c src/fit.h src/set.c src/save.c src/show.c:  "set fit nolog"

	* term/tek.trm: Remove SIXEL_set_color() terminal entry.  This function
	does not perform the operation expected by the core code (change the
	current color for lines/texts/points/etc). Instead it redefines one of
	16 linetypes.  In gnuplot version 5 this causes most objects to be
	drawn in black.  Removing the entry allows the sixel terminal to work
	more or less like a fixed color 16-pen plotter.
	Bug #1556

2015-02-24  Mojca Miklavec  <mojca.miklavec.lists@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac m4/apple.m4 term/aquaterm.trm:
	Correct "Aquaterm" to "AquaTerm" (framework name is case sensitive).

2015-02-23  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.c:  Special case code for axis tickmarks in polar plots was 
	incorrectly being applied to all axes, not just the polar axis.
	Bug #1569

2015-02-18  Shigeharu Takeno  <shige@iee.niit.ac.jp>

	* term/gd.trm (PNG_vector): Prevent accummulated round-off error in
	dotted line emulation by using (double) variables to track incremental
	coordinates.
	Bug #1549

2015-02-18  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term.c (term_apply_lp_properties do_point load_linetype):
	Restore old (version 4) behavior of terminals such as hp pen plotter
	and pbm that do not support user-selected colors.
	Bug #1556

2015-02-15  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.h src/axis.c src/set.c:  Do away with 4 utility routines
	{set|get}_writeback_{min|max} that did nothing but provide a
	round-about way to access the next field in a structure that is
	already active. E.g. axis->min = get_writeback_min(axis) becomes
	axis->min = axis->writeback_min.

	* src/boundary.c src/color.c:  Remove dead code (commented-out extra
	parameter to gen_tics()).

2015-02-15  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/axis.h (AXIS_INDEX): Change value of NO_AXIS to -2.  Make
	AXIS_ARRAY_SIZE an enum entry, again.
	(NUMBER_OF_MAIN_VISIBLE_AXES): New name, to be used instead of
	LAST_REAL_AXIS.
	(LAST_REAL_AXIS): Removed.
	(AXIS_IS_SECOND, AXIS_IS_FIRST): New macros to formalize checking
	if an axis is among the second or first axes, respectively.
	(AXIS_MAP_FROM_FIRST_TO_SECOND, AXIS_MAP_FROM_SECOND_TO_FIRST):
	New macros to centrally define how to switch from a first axis to
	its corresponding secondary axis, and vice versa.
	(axis): Change type of linked_to_primary from bool to an actual
	pointer to the linked axis struct.
	(ACTUAL_STORE_WITH_LOG_AND_UPDATE_RANGE): Missing parentheses
	around macro argument use.  Use linked_to_primary as a pointer.

	* src/axis.c (setup_tics): Cloning takes only one argument now.
	(axis_output_tics): Rely less on axis array layout.
	(some_grid_selected): Use new axis range macro.
	(get_position_type): Use correct type for axis index argument.
	(get_position_default): Use correct type for localaxis index
	variable.  Catch attempted use of z2 axis.
	(clone_linked_axes): Use only one argument.  The other is implied
	anyway.  Do some sanity checks first up.

	* src/command.c (link_command): Initialize local variables.  Axis
	link information is a pointer now. Concentrate knowledge about
	links between axes more into axis methods.

	* src/eval.c (eval_link_function): Use correct type for axis index
	argument.

	* src/gplt_x11.c (plot_struct): Use new axis range name.
	(byteswap): Define variable more locally.
	(exec_cmd): New local pointer to make code easier to understand.
	Use new axis range name.

	* src/graphics.c (adjust_offsets): Concentrate knowledge about
	links between axes more into axis methods.

	* src/plot2d.c (eval_plots): Concentrate knowledge about links
	between axes more into axis methods.

	* src/save.c (save_set_all): Use new axis range name.
	(save_range): linked_to_primary is a pointer now.

	* src/show.c (show_zeroaxis): Use new macro about distinction
	between first and second axes.

	* src/unset.c (unset_logscale): Use new axis range name.
	(reset_command): linked_to_primary is a pointer now.

	* term/x11.trm (X11_text): Loop over AXIS_INDEX should use that
	type for the index variable.  Use new axis range name.

	* docs/doc2tex.c (section, puttex): Correct use for <ctype.h> functions on
	plain char requires a cast to unsigned char.

	* docs/doc2ms.c (section): Correct use for <ctype.h> functions on

	* src/gadgets.c (apply_pm3dcolor): Variable color specifier "palette cb"
	failed to handle log-scaling of the color axis.
	Bug #1560

	* src/mouse.c (load_mouse_variables): MOUSE_BUTTON was not set correctly.

2015-02-11  Erik Olofsen <olofsen@users.sf.net>

	* configure.vms:  update compile-time variables to include HAVE_VFPRINTF
	and MAX_PARALLEL_AXES

2015-02-09  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/boundary.c (do_key_sample_point) src/graphics.c (do_plot)
	src/graph3d.c (do_3dplot): Until now "with labels" plots could have
	a point associated with each label but the point style was not 
	indicated in the key.  Now it is.

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotIterms.cpp (drawPoint):
	Don't draw an extra dot at the nominal origin of each point symbol.

2015-02-06  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/interpol.c (cp_implode):  The monotonic cubic spline code
	does not expect or handle multiple curves in a single data set.
	Thus cp_implode should not set the total number of averaged points
	to more than the total corresponding to the first curve.
	Bug #1548

2015-02-03  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/plot2d.c:  Allow "noautoscale" keyword to appear anywhere in
	the plot command, not just immediately after the using specifier.

	* src/interpol.c:  Rework "smooth kdensity" so that
	1) it now handles logscale on y
	2) it treats xrange as other plot styles do; in particular it no longer
	limits the x range to that of the points making up the kernel.

2015-02-02  Shigeharu Takeno  <shige@iee.niit.ac.jp>

	* docs/term-ja.diff docs/gnuplot-ja.doc:
	Sync Japanese documentation to doc version 1.935

2015-02-01  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c (plot_betweencurves):  This routine now handles both
	the 3-column variant of filledcurved ("between") and the y1=<yval> or
	y2=<yval> variants. In order that various lower level routines do not
	get confused, set the same options flag FILLEDCURVES_BETWEEN for all
	of these.  (Bug fix)

2015-01-27  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/plot2d.c src/show.c docs/gnuplot.doc:  Report maximum number of
	parallel axes in "show version long".  Enforce this limit when plotting.
	Document the limitation.

	* src/util.c (gprintf):  The "%h" format want a proper multiplication
	sign rather than 'x' when possible.  We already do this for UTF8 and 
	CP1252, now add support for iso_8859_* encodings.

	* src/save.c:  Use "set xyplane relative" rather than the deprecated
	"set ticslevel".

2015-01-24  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/command.c (test_palette_subcommand):  Apply numeric locale to the
	$PALETTE datablock created by the "test palette" command.

	* term/pslatex.trm:  Separation of linetype/dashtype in version 5 means
	that term->set_color should not be turned into term->linetype.
	Bug #1545

	* src/term.c (term_test): Fix failure to save/restore arrow style.
	Use LT_SOLID for box around central text.
	Bug #1546

2015-01-20  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c:  Restore several lines of code that were inadvertantly
	lost in the revision to filledcurve processing (2015-01-16).

	* src/graphics.c src/help.c src/hidden3d.c src/interpol.c src/color.c
	src/graph3d.c:  Back in 2001 some comparator functions passed to qsort
	were made non-static to work around a bug in HPUX. The reason for that
	is long gone, so make them static as they ought to be.

2015-01-19  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/boundary.c src/set.c src/save.c: set/save/apply text justification

	src/standard.c src/stats.c src/term.c src/util.c term/lua.trm:
	Move the "undefined" status flag from udvt_entry->udv_undef into
	the value itself (udvt_entry->udv_value.type == NOTDEFINED).
	This prevents coding mistakes which would leave a data type in the
	value even though the variable itself is marked undefined.
	Also it allows tracking or setting the undefined status in routines
	that are passed a pointer to a value rather than a udvt_entry.

2015-01-16  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/tabulate.c:  Tabular output of time/date values should check the
	new flag output flag (tictype) rather than the input flag (datatype),
	and fall back to a generic time format if the axis doesn't have one.

	* src/time.c (gstrptime): If the time format explicitly includes day,
	month, or year then always do sanity checking on the interpreted date.
	Return NULL if the sanity check fails.  Previously the sanity check 
	was only done if that field of the format was evaluated (i.e. it was
	not done if input garbage caused parsing to terminate early), and
	zeros were returned in the time structure with no indication of failure.
	This "failure silently returns zero" behaviour is still kept for
	hour, minute, and second input fields.

	* demo/timedat.dat: Add a line of headers to exercise the new sanity
	checks in gstrptime.

	* src/graphics.c src/plot2d.c:  Fix breakage in plot style 
	filledcurves {above|below} y1=<yval> 

2015-01-15  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c (plot_filledcurves):  Reevaluate variable fill color
	for every polygon in the input stream to "with filledcurves".
	Bug/Feature Request #411

	* src/gadgets.c (apply_pm3dcolor) src/term.c (load_linetype):
	Remove special-cased test for monochrome terminals that can lead cause
	a failure to update the linecolor in version 5 (e.g. background->black).
	Bug fix 

2015-01-13  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (df_read_matrix) demo/matrix_index.dem:
	Handle named indices (extra line in data file containing name of 
	subsequent data matrix) for nonuniform ascii matrix data.
	Bug #1538

	* src/stats.c:  The special code path to handle ascii matrix data was
	not correct.  Fortunately the general case code works so long as the
	data is recognized as matrix data.  This removes the broken code path.

2015-01-10  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/save.c (save_tics):  The order in which tics options were saved
	could produce illegal syntax in the save file.
	Bug fix

	* term/cairo.trm (cairotrm_put_text):  For some reason the bold/italic
	flags can become stuck after printing text.  This patch fixes it by
	restoring the original terminal font after printing any enhanced text
	string, but I do not understand why this would be necessary for the
	cairo terminals when other terminals do not require it.
	Test case:  set key title "{/:Bold Hello}"; plot sin(x) title "World"
	Bug fix

2015-01-10  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/gd.trm:  Ensure that the brush used for drawing dotted lines

2015-01-10  Karl Ratzsch  <ratzsch@uni-freiburg.de>

	* docs/gnuplot.doc:  Clarify sampling used by '+' special file.

2015-01-10  Christoph Bersch <usenet@bersch.net>

	* src/multiplot.c demo/heatmaps.dem demo/layout.dem docs/gnuplot.doc:
	Fix inconsistencies in the margin and spacing options for
	"set multiplot layout".  Allow using character or screen units.
	Make the character/screen keyword sticky; i.e. it applies to all four
	values in the command `set multiplot margins screen 0.1,0.9,0.9,0.1`
	Issue appropriate errors or warnings if margins and spacing aren't set
	together.  Update and expand the documentation.

2015-01-09  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (df_determine_matrix_info):  Apply numeric locale
	when reading ascii matrix data.
	Bug #1536

2015-01-07  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* configure.ac: Qt5 check via pkg-config --variable=host_bins seems
	fragile; revise to work on two different test machines.

	* src/graphics.c src/graphics.h src/plot2d.c:  Improved handling of
	boxplot data with multiple "factors" (i.e. category labels). The data
	is now sorted only once, rather than once per factor.

2015-01-07  Achim Gratz  <Stromeko@nexgo.de>

	* configure.ac: Qt5 check via pkg-config should use --variable=host_bins 
	rather than --variable=exec_prefix

2015-01-06  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/boundary.c src/gadgets.h src/graph3d.c src/save.c src/set.c
	src/show.c src/unset.c:  Track font and enhanced flag for the key title
	separately from those for the key entries.
	Bug #1525

	* docs/gnuplot.doc src/set.c src/show.c:
	In 5.0.0 the set margin command interpreted 4 values in the order
	  set margin <left>, <right>, <top>, <bottom>
	but this order in non-intuitive and conflicts with the order in
	other commands (e.g. set multiplot layout).  CHANGE this to
	  set margin <left>, <right>, <bottom>, <top>
	Note that the code now sanity checks that (top > bottom), so this change
	will not be noticed for margins given in screen coordinates.

2015-01-06  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c src/graphics.h src/plot2d.c:  Simplify the boxplot
	data handling. Collapse the separate filter_boxplot_factor() and
	filter_boxplot() into a single routine with a single supporting
	routine compare_ypoints().  Points are now sorted using the "factor"
	as a primary key, rather than using a separate pass to overwrite
	all y values to VERYLARGE if the factor does not match.
	Inspired by a patch from Jouke Witteveen  <j.witteveen@gmail.com>
	Bug #1532

2015-01-04  Jouke Witteveen  <j.witteveen@gmail.com>

	* src/plot2d.c (check_or_add_boxplot_factor) src/gadgets.h:
	When the requested "factor" column of boxplot data is missing or
	empty, the y value was being stored instead.  Now we store
	DEFAULT_BOXPLOT_FACTOR (-1) instead, since this can never be
	mistaken for a label array index.
	EAM: Store this factor index in z rather than ylow.  This prepares
	for a later patch to get rid of repeated swapping of y and ylow
	values rather than simply looking at the stored index directly.
	Bug #1532

2015-01-03  Jouke Witteveen  <j.witteveen@gmail.com>

	* src/plot2d.c (check_or_add_boxplot_factor):  Distinguish between
	boxplot category labels where one is a leading substring of the other.
	Bug #1532

2015-01-01  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/set.c src/boundary.c src/graph3d.c:  Add a sanity check to 
	ensure that the top margin is above the bottom margin.  This corrects
	for possible user confusion or error in specifying on one line
	set margins <left>, <right>, <bottom>, <top>   # (wrong order)

2014-12-30  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp (qt_atexit): Sanity check.

2014-12-19 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp (wxtPanel::wxt_cairo_create_bitmap):
	Another fix for the wxt terminal linked against wxWidgets 3.0.
	wxWidgets + wxgtk version 2.8 were fine with the sequence
	    delete cairo_bitmap;
	    cairo_bitmap = new wxBitmap(*image);
	but version 3.0 hits a use-after-free that can be attributed to a
	UI-triggered event invoking OnPaint(), which tries to access the old
	bitmap before the new one has been assigned.  Omitting the delete
	"cures" this, but then there is a memory leak.  Empirical tests seem
	to show that it suffices to defer the delete operation until after
	the assignment operation.  A proper interlock might be better yet.
 
2014-12-18 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>
 
	* src/datafile.c (df_parse_string_field): If an input data file uses
	Mac OS-9 format with \r as a line terminator, the entire file is
	mis-recognized as one very long line.  If there are nevertheless
	recognizable field separators, the code to split out string fields into
	separate saved storage goes crazy, consuming huge amounts of memory.
	Detect and warn if an input string field exceeds MAX_LINE_LEN.
	Bug #1445 (also see Bug #1355)

	* src/command.c (do_line):
	Report error if a "load" file fails to close an open bracketed clause.
	Bug #1522

2014-12-18  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	Use GE_replot for the former, GE_keypress('e') for the latter.
	Reject auto-generated replot requests while multiplot is active.
	(wxt was already doing this; now we extend it to qt and x11 also).
	Bug #1521

	src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp src/win/wgraph.c src/win/wpause.c
	src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp src/wxterminal/wxt_term.h:
	Revise "pause mouse" handling on Windows to handle windows, wxt, qt
	and caca terminals.  Test if the current terminal window is actually
	open before waiting for mouse input. (Not yet implemented for qt.)
	The windows terminal no longer expects the core code to reset the
	paused_for_mouse flag (like the qt, wxt and x11 terminals).  The
	code no longer opens an invisible window to handle "pause mouse" and
	code to close this window when "pause mouse" mode ends can thus be
	removed.  Interrupting pause mouse via Ctrl-C should now be possible.
	Bug #1502

	* term/caca.trm (waitforinput):  Support "pause mouse" if the graph is
	shown in a window. Bugfix.

	* docs/windows/doc2html.c:  Rename variable "basename" to "name" to
	avoid a name conflict on some platforms.

2014-12-13 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp (wxtPanel::wxt_cairo_refresh):
	The wxt terminal has been failing when linked against wxgtk3.0.
	The overt symptom is a library assert statement sometimes followed by a
	segfault:
	  ./src/gtk/dcclient.cpp(2043): assert "m_window" failed in DoGetSize():
	  GetSize() doesn't work without window [in thread 7fb21f386700]
	  Call stack:
	  [00] wxOnAssert()
	  [01] wxClientDCImpl::DoGetSize(int*, int*) const
	  [02] wxBufferedDC::UnMask()
	Both the assert and the segfault are due to the plot window not yet
	having been rendered on the screen. The documented wxwidgets function
	panel->IsShownOnScreen() fails to reliably detect this condition, so we
	must use our own window id bookkeeping to skip any refresh commands
	before the window appears.

2014-11-23 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.c src/set.c: The full names of the parallel axes are too long
	to fit in character arrays built to hold the simpler name "x2/cb/etc".
	But the 'set' commands using these arrays do not apply to parallel axes,
	so we avoid problems by never loading these arrays for parallel axes.

2014-11-21 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/gd.trm:  Replace the dotted-line code in PNG_vector with an 
	adaptation of the dash pattern code used by canvas.trm.

	* src/term.c (term_apply_lp_properties):  Special linetype LT_AXIS is
	intended to produce a dotted line if possible, even on terminals that
	do not support the general dash pattern mechanism introduced in v5.
	This means that when rendering lines with linetype LT_AXIS the 
	dashtype code should not be called at all. This bug affected at least
	the gd and qt terminals.
	Bug #1516

	* src/axis.c (axis_name) src/save.c: paxis tics and range settings
	were not being saved.

	* src/show.c: formatting typos (missing \t at beginning of line)

	* src/graphics.c (map_position_r): If only the x coorinate delta is
	requested, don't bother to calculate delta y, particularly because
	delta y=0 will fail if y is log scale.
	Bug #1512

2014-11-21  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/config/mingw/Makefile:  Build gnuplot-tikz.help.

	* src/config/config.mgw:  Sync with config.h created by autoconf tools.

2014-11-18 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.*: The toolbar widgets for replot/zoom/grid
	require intervention by the core code in order to act.  This is not
	possible when in -persist mode after the parent process has exited,
	so disable the toolbar widgets.

2014-11-16  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* term/Makefile.am.in (Makefile.am): Drop creation of conditional
	definition of build_lua.
	(all, $(srcdir)/lua/gnuplot-tikz.help): Drop rules for lua help
	file fragment generation.

	* docs/Makefile.am (LUA_HELP) [BUILD_LUA]: Define to name of lua
	help file fragment.
	($(LUA_HELP)) [BUILD_LUA]: Build lua help file fragment.
	(allterm.h): Depend on $(LUA_HELP).

	* term/lua.trm: Make inclusion of help file fragment depend on
	HAVE_LUA.  Needed for doc builds that unconditionally include all
	terminals' help. Remove "lua/" from include file name.

2014-11-15  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* term/Makefile.am.in ($(srcdir)/lua/gnuplot-tikz.help): Test for
	file existence is -f, not -x.

2014-11-15 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/Makefile.am.in: rebuild term/lua/gnuplot-tikz.help
	only if --with-lua, otherwise skip this in building the docs

2014-11-12 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/lua/gnuplot-tiz.help (remove from repository)
	* term/Makefile.am.in: rebuild term/lua/gnuplot-tikz.help

2014-11-07 Akira Kakuto <kakuto@fuk.kindai.ac.jp>

	* term/luz/gnuplot-tikz.lua:  Use \errmessage rather than \PackageError
	because not all TeX variants provide the latter.

2014-11-06 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/time.c (gstrftime xstrftime) docs/gnuplotdoc demo/timedat.dem:
	Introduce a new time format modifier 't', used to distinguish dates
	from times.  This allows formatting time data as hours/minutes/seconds
	relative to time=0 rather than as a calendar date.  Compare these
	representations of the stored value -3672.50 seconds:
	    default date format    # "12/31/69 \n 22:58"
	    format "%tH:%tM:%tS"   # "-01:01:12"
	    format "%.2tH hours"   # "-1.02 hours"
	    format "%tM:%.2tS"     # "-61:12.50"

2014-11-04  Daniel J Sebald <daniel.sebald@ieee.org>

	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp: Restore Copy-to-Clipboard option in wxt
	toolbar.

2014-11-04 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (f_dollar f_column):  When a data field containing NaN
	is encountered, df_readline returns DF_UNDEFINED to the caller.
	This is sufficient to handle plotting that point per se, but if the
	value is also used in evaluation of an arithmetic expression with a side
	effect then this undefined status flag is not available. For consistency
	we now pass NaN to the expression evaluation code as well.  E.g.
		plot FOO using 1:(side_effect=f($2))
	could leave some random (probably left-over) value in side_effect.
	Now if $2 is NaN and for example f(x) = (x+foo) then side_effect becomes
	NaN also.  Before this side_effect would have received some other,
	incorrect, numerical value.

	* src/save.c (save_dashtype):  dashtype -1 is an internal flag; do not
	save it to an external file.

2014-11-02  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* config/config.oww: If we're going to use strnlen_s for strnlen,
	must define according C99 library extension macro.

	* src/set.c (set_dashtype): Command input following the 'default'
	option would cause a crash by double-deleting from linked list.
	(parse_histogramstyle): Option "title" is not protected against
	multiple use.  This might cause double-free of font field.

	* src/bf_test.c (main): Move file-open error handling further up,
	to avoid (harmless) memory leak.  Use standard failure return
	instead of magic constant.  Allocations were relying on
	sizeof(float)==sizeof(float *).

	* src/getcolor.c (GROW_GRADIENT): Query realloc()ed pointer for its
	own type's size; safer than making assumptions about it.
	(approximate_palette): Dito; and in this case the type was
	actually wrong.

2014-11-01 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/cairo.trm (cairotrm_put_text) src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp
	(wxt_put_text):  Start each top level enhanced text recursion  using
	the full font name given in "set term font 'foo'", rather than the
	most recent font stored in the plot (which is only the font family
	name, not bold/italic/other).  This maintains bold or italic in the
	original font name, but I am not entirely convinced that it cannot
	overwrite an intentional change in font family.
	Bug #1505

2014-10-31 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/plot2d.c:  Issue a warning if someone tries to specify a
	sampling range for a data plot.
	Bug #1510

2014-10-31  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp (wxtFrame::OnSize):  Only replot on
	resize if the wxt settings were properly initialized by wxt_init().
	On Windows, this would otherwise cause many graph windows to be
	opened when the first plot command is issued and gnuplot finally
	hangs or crashes.
	Bugfix.

2014-10-30  Daniel J Sebald <daniel.sebald@ieee.org>

	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.{cpp|h}: Replace the clipboard widget on the
	wxt terminal toolbar with a widget to save current plot to a file.
	EAM: Output to PNG via standard wxWidgets component
	     Output to SVG or PDF by replaying cairo history for current plot.

2014-10-29  Christoph Bersch <usenet@bersch.net>

	* term/lua/gnuplot-tikz.lua term/luz.trm:  Boxed text support.

2014-10-29  Shigeharu Takeno  <shige@iee.niit.ac.jp>

	* docs/gnuplot.doc docs/term-ja.diff docs/gnuplot-ja.doc:
	Fix typos. Sync Japanese documentation to 1.921

2014-10-26 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/wxt.trm src/wxterminal/wxt_term.h src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.*:
	Add a checkbox to the tool widget controlling whether or not the
	plot is redrawn via "replot" as the terminal window is resized.

2014-10-19  Christoph Bersch <usenet@bersch.net>

	* term/lua/gnuplot-tikz.lua:  Missing initializations.
	Bug #1503

2014-10-16  Christoph Bersch <usenet@bersch.net>

	* src/stats.c:  The stats code was confusing the x and y dimensions of
	matrix data.  E.g. it would report a 5X7 matrix as being 7X5, and 
	mis-calculate the indices of the min/max values.
	Bug #1501

	* term/lua/gnuplot-tikz.lua:  Fix incorrect font test.
	Bug (Feature Request) #409

2014-10-16  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/win/wgnuplib.h src/win/wgraph.c term/win.trm:  The `size` option
	now refers to the canvas size instead of the window size in order to be
	consistent with the qt and wxt terminals.  The window size can still be
	set with the new `wsize` option. Settings are now included in output of
	`show term`.
	Bug #1400

2014-10-11  Christoph Bersch <usenet@bersch.net>

	* term/lua/gnuplot-tikz.lua:  LT_AXIS and LT_SOLID imply specific
	dash types.
	Bug #1491

2014-10-11  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/axis.c (copy_or_invent_formatstring): Lower end of axis may
	need more precision in invented format than the distance between
	max and min. Bug #1496

2014-10-08 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/save.c (save_all): Write out the filename last used for plotting.
	This makes a saved plot command referencing '' slightly more useful.

2014-10-07 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/misc.c (lf_push lf_pop):  If lf_push/lf_pop are invoked from
	do_string_and_free to handle bracketed if{} or do{} expressions, they
	should not touch the call arguments ARG1, ARG2, ...  Save/restore of the
	call arguments is only needed if lf_push/lf_pop are invoked by "call".
	Bug #1494

2014-10-05 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.h src/set.c (set_format):

	Timefmt revision part 6
	- Add tictype keywords to "set format {axis} {time|geographic|numeric}"
	- Reset to numeric on "unset format"

2014-10-04 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h src/datafile.c src/fit.c src/mouse.c src/parse.c
	src/save.c src/set.c src/setshow.h src/show.c src/unset.c
	docs/gnuplot.doc demo/gantt.dem:

	Timefmt revision part 1 of 4
	- Remove axis->timefmt and replace it with a single global timefmt.
	  This is what the documentation has always said, but it breaks the
	  undocumented command:   set timefmt y "fmt-different-from-xaxis-fmt"
	- Add a new flag axis->tictype to control interpretation of tic format.
	  axis->datatype will continue to control input format interpretation. 
	- If only a single parameter is passed to timecolumn() try to emulate
	  the version 4 behavior (use global timefmt)

	* src/save.c src/save.h src/setshow.h src/show.c:

	Timefmt revision part 2 of 4
	- Replace macro SAVE_NUM_OR_TIME with routine save_num_or_time_input().
	  This routine uses _input_ data format, mostly for reporting axis range.

	* src/save.c src/save.h src/show.c:

	Timefmt revision part 3 of 4
	- Show and save xyz positions using time-format coordinates when needed.
	  Note that like axis ranges, these are meant to be read in again later
	  so they are written using the input format not the output format.

	* src/axis.c (get_tics copy_or_invent_formatstring) src/set.c
	src/unset.c src/show.c src/save.c docs/gnuplot.doc demo/world.dem:

	Timefmt revision part 4 of 4
	- New command set {xyz}tics {time|geographic|numeric} sets axis->tictype
	- Output formats chosen based on axis->tictype rather than axis->datatype
	- Report axis->tictype setting with axis->format in "show" and "save"

2014-10-03  Christoph Bersch <usenet@bersch.net>

	* term/lua/gnuplot-tikz.lua:  linetype -1 must reset dashtype to solid.
	Bug #1491

2014-10-01 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/misc.c (arrow_parse): Remove order dependence of "fixed" keyword.

	* src/hidden3d.c (draw_edge): When an arrow is split into segments by
	hidden surface processing, only keep the arrowhead on the original tip.

	* src/plot2d.c (get_data): Timedata for HISTOGRAMS requires a special
	case.

	* src/boundary.c src/color.c src/gadgets.c src/gadgets.h src/graph3d.c
	src/graphics.c src/hidden3d.c src/misc.c src/mouse.c src/multiplot.c
	src/term.c:  Remove wasted parameter passed to apply_pm3dcolor(),
	reset_textcolor(), and get_offsets().

	* docs/gnuplot.doc:  Replace outdated section on `set xdata time`.

2014-09-26 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/js/gnuplot_mouse.js:  Typo in logical test for hypertext.

	* src/axis.h src/save.c src/set.c src/show.c src/unset.c src/graphics.c
	src/graph3d.c:   set [*]tics {{no}enhanced}

2014-09-24  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/win/wgraph.c term/win.trm:  The windows terminal allowed users
	to change linetypes via an ini file or with the help of a dialog.  This
	has been superseeded by the more general `set linetype` mechanism.
	The old code is still available but only active with WIN_CUSTOM_PENS
	defined during compilation.

	* src/win/wgraph.c src/win/wgidplus.c:  Accept zero point size.
	Eliminates drawing of unwanted point symbols for labelled contours.
	Bugfix

2014-09-24 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/aed.trm term/v384.trm
	config/makefile.dj2 config/makefile.emx config/makefile.vms
	configure.vms docs/doc2texi.el docs/Makefile.am src/makefile.all
	src/makefile.awc src/term.h:

	Remove obsolete terminals:
	aed:  pre-1980 display device ($15,000) with 500x500 pixels, 256 colors
	v384: Vectrix VX 384 mid 1980s graphics display terminal ($5000) with
	      672x480 pixels, 512 colors

	* src/interpol.c:  Force the number of intervals used for interpolating
	monotonic cubic splines ("smooth mcsplines") to be at least twice the
	number of data points.

2014-09-22  Christoph Bersch <usenet@bersch.net>

	* src/misc.c (parse_fillstyle): Remove order dependence of keyword 
	"transparent".

	* term/lua.trm term/lua/gnuplot-tikz.lua:
	Support RGBA linecolors and LT_NODRAW.  Add a linewidth terminal option.

2014-09-20  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/fit.c src/fit.h src/save.c src/set.c src/show.c src/unset.c
	docs/gnuplot.doc demo/fit.dem:  Remove xerrors option (which requires 3
	columns) since it is not like the xerrorbars plot style (which requires 4). 
	Rename `noerrors` option to `unitweights`.  Let the fit command default
	to `unitweights`, i.e. do not interpret the last column of the using
	spec as z-errors.  Add a command `set fit v4|v5` to switch between
	old-style command line syntax and the new one. Default to `v5`, but
	`reset` does not change the current setting.

	Note that this change is backward-incompatible with v5-rc1 and v5-rc2.
	However it restores compatibility with v4, subject to the restriction
	that all independent variables must appear in the "fit" command itself
	(see below).

	* src/fit.c: Ethan A Merritt - use the tally of dummy variable names
	to detect version 4 syntax in which the last column of a using spec
	contains zerror but no "*error" keyword is provided.

2014-09-18 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/fit.c src/parse.c src/parse.h (int fit_dummy_var[]):
	Track the occurrence of dummy variable names in a fit command. This lets
	us count the independent variables so long as they are not obscured.
	   fit f(x,y) 'data' using 1:2:3:4      # flags use of 'x' and 'y'
	   fit x*y    'data' using 1:2:3:4      # flags use of 'x' and 'y'
	   g(x) = x*y;
	   fit g(x)   'data' using 1:2:3:4      # flags 'x', doesn't notice 'y'
	In each case fit_dummy_var[0] is 1.  In the 3rd case fit_dummy_var[1]
	is 0 but should be 1.  Fixing this would be quite hard.

2014-09-18  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/win/wgnuplib.h src/wgraph.c term/win.trm:  windows terminal
	supports the toggle command.

2014-09-18 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c:  Revised error message for datafile open failure.

2014-09-14 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/tables.c src/command.c src/command.h docs/gnuplot.doc:
	New command `toggle {<plotno> | "plottitle" | all} has the same effect
	as left-clicking on the key entry for a plot shown by an interactive
	terminal (qt, wxt, x11).

2014-09-12  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/mouse.c (xDateTimeFormat):  Use ggmtime() instead of gmtime() to
	avoid platform specific restrictions.
	Bug #1470

2014-09-09  Pieter-Tjerk de Boer <p.t.deboer@utwente.nl>

	* docs/gnuplot.doc:  Update help on fit to new command syntax.

	* src/fit.c:  Fix init of num_errors.

2014-09-09  Akira Kakuto <kakuto@fuk.kindai.ac.jp>

2014-09-08  Christoph Junghans <ottxor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in:  New option --without-libcerf

2014-09-08 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/misc.c (lp_parse parse_colorspec):  Allow a quoted colorname to
	immediately follow the keywords lc|linecolor|fc|fillcolor; i.e. in this
	case the additional rgbcolor keyword is optional.

2014-09-07 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/plot2d.c:  "set linetype 1 pt 'A'; plot x with lp" requires that
	the plot->labels field be initialized before plotting.

	* src/save.c:  handle PT_CHARACTER when saving linetype

2014-09-05 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	src/plot2d.c src/plot3d.c src/save.c src/set.c src/ show.c src/term.c:

	The field lp_style_type.pointflag was variously used as a Boolean,
	an integer, or a magic number indicating an uninitialized state.
	Clean this up by replacing it with a bitfield lp_style_type.flags
	with defined bits LP_SHOW_POINTS LP_NOT_INITIALIZED LP_EXPLICIT_COLOR.
	This has the side effect of allowing a trivial fix for a regression
	in 4.6.5 that caused "set hidden3d; splot ... lc <foo>" to ignore the
	requested color.  See Bugs #1284 #1475

2014-09-05  Karl Ratzsch  <ratzsch@uni-freiburg.de>

	Add a 2nd parameter to the API term->modify_plots(operations, plotno).
	All terminals for which this entry point is not NULL are updated

	* src/fit.c:  Handle columnheaders in input to "fit".
	Bug #1467

	* src/misc.c (lp_parse):  Flag "set object N lt <lt>" as an error,
	since currently this must be done be "set object N fs bo <lt>".
	Probably we should figure out how to make this command work, but
	better to issue an error than accept it and then ignore it.

	* Branchpoint for 5.0 (cvs tag -b branch-5-0-stable)

	The main (development) branch is now marked 5.1 and will eventually
	be used as the basis for a future release named gnuplot version 5.2.

				>>> NOTE <<<

	Starting now 
	============

	* Bugfixes for version 5 should be applied to both the main branch
	(5.1 == this one) and the stable branch (branch-5-0-stable).
	They will first appear in patchlevel releases 5.0.1, 5.0.2, and so on.

	* Major new features and experimental changes belong here, not in the
	stable branch.  They will appear eventually in release 5.2.

	* Minor new features can go in both branches at your discretion, but
	remember that the stable branch should ideally never break.
	That means new code should be tested here in the development
	branch first, and only after testing be added or back-ported to the
	stable branch.

2014-08-20 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c:  Distinct empirical scale factors for

2014-08-18 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c (place_arrows) src/graph3d.c (place_arrows3d):
	Only invoke the arrowheads only code if there really is an arrowhead.

2014-08-18  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* config/mingw/Makefile (VPATH): Drop $W from VPATH.  Necessary to
	avoid circular dependency on wgnuplot.mnu
	(%.$(O)): Use pattern rule instead of VPATH to build Windows
	source files.
	(VERSIONING): Avoid inverted logic in makefile conditional.
	(console, windows, pipes): Simplify by letting the default rule in
	the sub-make handle things.
	(default, all): Versioning is really needed by $(TARGET) rule,
	so let that handle constructing it.
	($(TARGET)): Do VERSIONING first, drop dependencies on icon files.
	(%.o): Use pattern rules to build Qt source files.  Much simpler
	than spelling it out long hand for every single source file.

2014-08-15 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/bf_test.c src/Makefile.am src/binary.* (removed)
	config/makefile.os2 config/makefile.dj2 config/makefile.cyg
	config/cygwin/Makefile config/mingw/Makefile config/msvc/Makefile:
	Remove bf_test dependence on all other gnuplot files and libraries.
	This makes binary.c and binary.h superfluous.
	Bugs #1412 #1451

	* src/makefile.all src/makefile.awc: Remove mention of binary.o

	* config/*/Makefile: Remove alloc and binary from bf_test dependencies

	* src/graphics.c (place_objects) src/set.c (set_obj):
	Apply default rectangle style at the time of a "set object rect"
	command rather than waiting until the rectangle is drawn.  This prevents
	the default style line/dash settings from overriding explicit rectangle
	commands.
	Bug #1460

	* src/save.c (save_linetype):  Bugfix - dashtype was being saved only if
	there was also a point type.

	* src/gadgets.c (apply_pm3dcolor):  Don't clobber current dashtype by
	calling term->linetype(LT_BLACK).  Call term->set_color(BLACK_COLORSPEC)
	instead.

	* src/graphics.c (place_arrows) src/graph3d.c (place_arrows3d):
	Force solid lines for arrow heads.

2014-08-15  Shigeharu Takeno  <shige@iee.niit.ac.jp>

	* src/gplt_x11.c:  For single byte fonts gnuplot_x11 uses a list of
	previously used fonts to speed up the search for a new target font.
	Now we add an equivalent for multi-byte font search.

2014-08-14 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c (do_rectangle) src/graph3d.c (map3d_position_r)
	demo/rectangle.dem:  Fix y extent and clipping of rectangles with
	negative y coord or inverted axes.
	Bug #1462

2014-08-05 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/mouse.c (event_buttonpress):  Remove extraneous event_reset.

2014-08-02 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/misc.c (parse_colorspec):  Apply user-defined line colors
	to text color also.
	Bug #1452

	src/misc.c src/save.c src/set.c src/term.c src/term_api.h:
	Store custom dashtype string as a constant length character array
	rather than a dynamically allocated string.  This fixes memory
	leakage that happened whenever a linetype using dashes was discarded.

2014-08-01 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/mouse.c (event_buttonpress):  Trap mouse button click on
	press rather than on release so that "pause mouse {button1|any}"
	takes precedence over a key binding to the mouse button.
	Bugfix

2014-07-30 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/x11.trm:  Remove misleading mention of -noevents.  This is a
	command line option for gnuplot_x11, not for gnuplot itself.

	* src/datafile.c docs/gnuplot.doc demo/heatmaps.dem:
	New text input matrix keywords `columnheaders` and `rowheaders`.
	These handle reading matrix data from a csv file in which the first
	row and/or column contains labels rather than data.

	* src/eval.c (update_plot_bounds):  Provide a user-visible copy of
	the current terminal scale (oversampling, etc) as GPVAL_TERM_SCALE.
	Bug #1291

2014-07-28 Allin Cottrell  <cottrell@wfu.edu>

	* src/syscfg.h:  Report 32/64 bit Windows build in version string

2014-07-28 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c:  Do not pass a linewidth of zero to the
	cairo library.  The linewidth of LT_AXIS is now set in the core code,
	do not further reduce it in gp_cairo_stroke().

2014-07-25 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/gplt_x11.c: Scale x11 dashlength with linewidth.

2014-07-23  Shigeharu Takeno  <shige@iee.niit.ac.jp>

	* src/mouse.c src/mouse.h src/set.c src/show.c docs/gnuplot.doc:
	New command 'set mouse zoomfactors <xfactor>,<yfactor>'

2014-07-22 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/gp_types.h src/plot2d.c (store2d_point):
	INRANGE/OUTRANGE refer to points that are inside/outside the plot
	boundaries as defined by xrange, yrange, etc.  They fail to handle
	points that are outside theta range limits given for polar data.
	That is, a point may be outside of trange [pi/2:pi] even though it
	would lie well inside the plot boundaries if drawn.
	Add a new category EXCLUDEDRANGE for such points. 

	* src/graphics.c (plot_impulses):  Test for EXCLUDEDRANGE data points
	so that set trange [theta_min:theta_max] actually does something.
	Bug #1439

	* demo/poldat.dem:  Make sure trange includes the whole plot.

2014-07-18 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* demo/Makefile.am.in: Do not create a symlink to GNUPLOT_X11 in the
	build directory during "make check". This was probably intended to 
	handle the rare case of ./configure --program-suffix=foo but it breaks
	the more common case of configuring on a system without x11 support
	and then running "make check" twice.
	Bugfix

2014-07-14 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/gadgets.c src/save.c src/set.c src/gadgets.h:
	Continue to recognize "set style increment user" even though it has
	been deprecated in favor of "set linetype".
	Bug #1411 (not really a bug)

2014-07-12 Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/parse.c (check_for_iteration):  Fix failure to detect some loop
	[start:end:increment] combinations that should be executed only once
	or not executed at all.
	Bug #1441

2014-07-10  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/set.c (set_dummy):  More sanity checks on "set dummy" syntax.
	Bug #1442

2014-07-06  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/set.c (load_tic_user):  "set Xtics ()" should clear the list
	of user-specified tics rather than setting tic generation to auto.

2014-07-04  Shigeharu Takeno  <shige@iee.niit.ac.jp>

	* docs/gnuplot.doc docs/term-ja.diff docs/gnuplot-ja.doc
	man/gnuplot.1 man/gnuplot-ja.1:
	Fix typos. Sync Japanese documentation to 1.896

2014-07-04  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/win/wgraph.c:  'q' closes graph window.

	* src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp (qt_options) term/wxt.trm (wxt_options):
	On Windows, the wxt and qt terminals can be used in the same session.

2014-07-01  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/cairo.trm, term/wxt.trm:
	Always report {no}enhanced property in "show term".

	* src/color.c: If the current terminal has property "monochrome" then
	convert all requests for constant color as "black".
	Bug #1423

2014-06-24  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/set.c src/show.c src/tables.c docs/gnuplot.doc:
	New command:  set margins <left>, <right>, <top>, <bottom>
	acts just like four successive commands set lmargin <left>, ...

	* src/unset.c:  unset margins

2014-06-20  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* configure.in src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.h:  The configuration test for
	wxWidgets >= 2.8 had no effect on code generation. Remove this test.

	* configure.in src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.h:  Revert the attemp to guess
	whether -lX11 is required by wxt. As feared, this causes problems on OSX
	and other platforms where wx is built on top of something other than X11.

2014-06-16  Karl Ratzsch  <ratzsch@uni-freiburg.de>

	* fit.c:  FIT_NITER holds number of iterations used by previous fit.

2014-06-16  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* configure.in src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.h:  wxWidgets versions > 2.8 want
	the main program to call XInitThreads(), but fail to specify -lX11 in 
	wxt-config.   So we force this ourselves.   [=> reverted 2014-06-20]
	Bug #1401

	* src/graphics.c (xtick2d_callback): Clip r axis tics and tic labels to
	the bounding box of the plot.
	Bug #1290

2014-06-15  Dmitri A. Sergatskov  <dasergatskov@gmail.com>

	* configure.in: Add LRELEASE for Qt5 autoconfiguration

2014-06-15  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/plot.c (main):  Fix persist mode on Windows when reading
	from a pipe.
	See Bug #1322

2014-06-15  Akira Kakuto <kakuto@fuk.kindai.ac.jp>

	* src/binary.c src/datafile.h src/syscfg.h:  LFS support on Windows
	for MSVC and MinGW.
	See also Patch #675

2014-06-14  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.h src/axis.c src/boundary.c src/plot2d.c (eval_plots):
	Unlike all other axes, log scaling was being applied to the color axis
	(cb) in do_plot() rather than in the caller eval_plots().
	This caused "refresh" (as opposed to "replot") to fail.  Move the
	log-scale correction up to eval_plots() like the other axes.
	Bug #1425

	* src/misc.c (prepare_call):  Allow parenthesized expressions as
	call parameters.  The value is passed as a string.

	* src/command.c (exit_command):  New option "exit error 'message'"
	prints the message and return to the top command line, breaking out
	of any loops or calls cleanly.  In non-interactive mode the program
	then exits.

2014-06-13  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp (qt_waitforinput):  Fix index error
	when trying to stop thread which reads from pipe.
	Bug #1426

2014-06-13  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (df_generate_pseudodata):  Do not try to access plot
	structure if we were called from fit rather than plot.
	Bug #1427

2014-06-12  Christoph Bersch <usenet@bersch.net>

	* term/lua.trm term/lua/gnuplot-tikz.lua:
	Scale dashlength with linewidth.

2014-06-11  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/mouse.c (event_reset) src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotWindow.{h|cpp}:
	Window close events from qt were not being passed through to the main
	program, so "pause mouse close" did not work. Also a backgrounded 
	instance could hang rather than exit when the last plot window closed.
	Bug #1418

	* src/fit.c: Remove spurious test and error message for time data
	with only 2 columns in the using spec.
	Bug #1424

	* man/gnuplot.1: update

2014-06-11  Mojca Miklavec  <mojca.miklavec.lists@gmail.com>

	* term/aquaterm.trm:  Correctly support encoding CP1252.

2014-06-11  Tatsuro MATSUOKA <tmacchant3@yahoo.co.jp>

	* win/gnuplot.iss:  Include Qt platform DLLs in distribution package.

2014-06-10  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* docs/gnuplot.doc:  Add a section explaining the "persist" option.
	Bug #1418, #1419

	* term/post.trm term/svg.trm src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp:
	Add an empirical scale factor to the dashlength*linewidth computation to
	make the resulting patterns closer in total size to the built-in ones.

2014-06-10  Christoph Bersch <usenet@bersch.net>

	* term/post.trm term/svg.trm:  Scale dashlength with linewidth.

2014-06-09  Daniel J Sebald <daniel.sebald@ieee.org>

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotWidget.cpp (processEvent):  Always "resize"
	the initial plot to its own size.  This may work around strangeness on
	some systems that create the initial qt plot window with the wrong size.
	Bug #1417 (forwarded from Debian) Patch #661

2014-06-09  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/win/wgdiplus.cpp src/win/wgraph.c src/win/wgnuplib.h
	term/win.trm:
	Version 5 dashtypes. Custom dashtypes supported by GDI+ driver.

	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp:  Also "restore" the window state on
	"raise".
	Bug #1389

	* src/win/winmain.c (WinMain):  Change type from PASCAL to CALLBACK.

	* src/fit.c:  Test if covariance matrix is available before saving
	it to user variables.

2014-06-08  Shigeharu Takeno  <shige@iee.niit.ac.jp>

	* docs/gnuplot.doc win/README-Windows.txt win/README-ja.txt
	docs/gnuplot-ja.doc:  sync to docs version 1.891

2014-06-07  Mojca Miklavec  <mojca.miklavec.lists@gmail.com>

	* src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c:  Scale dashlength with linewidth, similar
	to what qt does.

2014-06-04  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/plot.c src/win/winmain.c|h term/caca.trm:  Only if a wxt, caca
	or windows terminal window is open, the -persist option is handled by
	keeping the main input loop running. This is unfortunate but maybe the
	best we can do since we are missing a process fork or detach mechanism.
	This avoids a zombie process when no plot windows are open in a
	session. For the qt terminal -persist works as on other platforms
	since it uses a secondary process.
	Bugs #1308, #1335, #1343

2014-06-03  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graph3d.c src/show.c src/save.c docs/gnuplot.doc:
	The hidden3d code processes the lines making up the plot border using
	the same algorithm as it does for the plot elements.  This renders
	partially occluded borders correctly for actual surfaces but fails to
	recognize occlusion for, e.g., 3D histograms drawn with impulses.
	New keyword option "set border behind" draws the border lines before
	the plot elements even for hidden3d plots.

	* src/term_api.h src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp:
	Change the implementation of greying out inactive keybox entries in wxt
	to use a textbox rather than the active area of the key entry.
	Bug #1416

	* src/hidden3d.c (draw_vertex):  Handle p_type == PT_CHARACTER.

2014-06-02  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/win/wgraph.c src/win/wgdiplus.cpp:
	Grey out key entries when corresponding plot is toggled off.

	* src/win/wgraph.c (GraphUpdateWindowPosSize) src/win/wgnuplib.h
	term/win.trm (WIN_options):  Immediately apply changes to window
	position and size.
	Bug #1400

	* src/datafile.h:  Revert the Windows LFS changes for now as
	they seem to cause problems on some systems.

2014-06-01  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.c src/gadgets.c src/misc.c src/set.c src/unset.c:
	Replace magic numbers with LAYER_{BEHIND|BACK|FRONT}.

	* src/graph3d.c: Remove obsolete (always true) conditional
	USE_GRID_LAYERS.  Minor clean up for the grid layer logic.

2014-06-01  Tatsuro MATSUOKA <tmacchant3@yahoo.co.jp>

	* win/gnuplot.iss:  Include gnuplot_qt.exe in installer.
	Patch #689

	* src/qtterminal/gnuplot_qt.cpp:  Search for Qt translation files
	in gnuplot's installation directory on Windows.
	Patch #687

2014-06-01  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.h:  Partial support for LFS on Windows. Currently 
	mostly useful for 64 bit builds since integers on the the gnuplot
	command line are limited to 31bits otherwise.
	Patch #675

2014-06-01  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* config/mingw/Makefile:  Target 'clean' and 'veryclean' include 
	Qt files, see patch #688.

	* config/mingw/Makefile win/gnuplot.iss:  Include RELEASE_NOTES.
	Add "qt" as option as default terminal.

2014-05-30  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/post.trm term/cairo.trm:  The "header" keyword for epslatex
	and related terminals can introduce a string of arbitrary length.
	Therefore it is not safe to try to store it in the fixed length 
	term_options character array.
	Bug #1413

	* term/gd.trm:  Limit the stored length of the font so that term_options
	cannot overflow.
	Bug #1413

	* Makefile.am RELEASE_NOTES:  Include Release Notes in the distribution
	package.

	* FAQ.PDF:  Update for version 5.

	* src/gplt_x11.c:
	Grey out key entries when corresponding plot is toggled off.

2014-05-29  Akira Kakuto <kakuto@fuk.kindai.ac.jp>

	* term/caca.trm:  Modify nominal codepage to accommodate CJK Windows.

2014-05-29  Tatsuro MATSUOKA <tmacchant3@yahoo.co.jp>

	* config/mingw/Makefile:  Support compilation of the qt terminal.
	Patch #684

2014-05-29  Karl Ratzsch  <ratzsch@uni-freiburg.de>

	* docs/gnuplot.doc:  Improve documentation of `update` command.
	Patch #686

	* src/win/wgdiplus.c src/win/wgraph.c:  Change order of pointtypes to
	match the sequence in other terminals (cairo, postscript, gd, svg).
	Patch #681

2014-05-28  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graph3d.c (plot3d_points):  Handle pointtype PT_CHARACTER.

	* src/plot3d.c:  Rearrange the order of testing for plot style options
	so that it is not possible to end up with uninitialized font or text
	properties.

2014-05-27  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (df_readascii): Report status DF_UNDEFINED if a data
	value evaluates to the constant "NaN", just as if we calculated it on
	the fly to be e.g. 1/0.
	* src/stats.c: Remove out-of-date comment that incorrectly describes 
	what happens in this case.
	Bug #1408

2014-05-26  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/js/gnuplot_svg.js term/svg.trm:
	Grey out key entries when corresponding plot is toggled off.

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotItems.* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp:
	Grey out key entries when corresponding plot is toggled off.

	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp (wxt_grey_out_key_box):
	Grey out key entries when corresponding plot is toggled off.

2014-05-24  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp (wxt_waitforinput):  Do not wait for an
	event when only checking for mouse events.
	Bugfix

2014-05-23  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/boundary.c:  A width adjustment for the length of the key title
	was being applied to every column of entries in the key instead of just
	once for the whole key.  Apply the "set key {no}enhanced" property to
	the key title as well as to the individual plot titles.
	Bugfix.

2014-05-19  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.h: Apparently wxWidgets3 (wxgtk3) threads call
	into Xlib but fail to initialize X threading before doing so. Therefore
	we must call XInitThreads before forking wxt threads.
	Bug #1401

2014-05-19  Karl Ratzsch  <ratzsch@uni-freiburg.de>

	* term/emf.trm: Add point types pentagon (14) and filled pentagon (15)

2014-05-16  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term.c (load_linetype):  As documented, "set linetype cycle N"
	should only affect line properties (color, width, dash), not point
	properties (type, interval, size).  This got lost somewhere, which 
	meant point types > linetype_recycle_count were never used by default.
	Now they are.  This means that, as intended, 'with linespoints' cycles
	through (linetype_recycle_count * terminal's_max_point_type) distinct
	combinations before repeating so long as those two numbers are
	mutually prime.  Unfortunately that's not guaranteed and is terminal-
	dependent.  We really need a "set pointtype cycle M" command also so
	that you can choose M to be prime relative to N.
	Bugfix.

	* INSTALL docs/gnuplot.doc:  Update description of new features.

2014-05-15  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* configure.in PATCHLEVEL src/version.c docs/titlepag.tex:
	Bump version information to 5.0.rc1

	* demo/dashtypes.dem:  Avoid irrelevant warning message.

2014-05-14  Karl Ratzsch  <ratzsch@uni-freiburg.de>

	* term/svg.trm src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c:
	Add point types pentagon (14) and filled pentagon (15)

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotItems.cpp:
	(EAM) Add point types pentagon (14) and filled pentagon (15)

2014-05-13  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/command.c src/tables.c src/tables.h: Remove undocumented routine
	test_time(). It was never updated to handle sub-second time precision,
	and in any case the functionality is now covered adequately by
	"print strptime()" and "print strftime()".

	* src/color.c (filled_polygon_3dcoords filled_polygon_zfixed)
	src/pm3d.c (filled_color_contour_plot):	 The option "set pm3d at C" is
	undocumented and doesn't work anyhow.  Wrap the corresponding code in
	#ifdef PM3D_CONTOURS . This disabled code may or may not be useful for
	some future implementation of filled contours.

	* term/post.trm (PS_dashtype): Always stroke the previous path before
	setting a new dashtype.

2014-05-11  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/util.c (LOCAL_BUFFER_SIZE): New constant.
	(gprintf): Use constant to identify buffer size, instead of typing
	the same magic number multiple times. Insert warning about
	remaining magic number.

	* src/plot2d.c (get_data): Fix buffer overflow a bit more cleanly.
	(compare_boxplot_factors): Insert warning about magic number.

2014-05-11  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/plot2d.c (get_data): fix buffer overflow

	* src/datafile.c (f_stringcolumn): Return an empty string if asked for
	stringcolumn(N) on an empty field of a *.csv file.  Otherwise it would
	return NULL which may cause a segfault later on.
	Bugfix.

	* src/datafile.c (df_readascii): If xticlabels(f(n)) returns a 
	non-string value then do not generate an axis tic.  It used to issue
	a warning about illegal string values but generated a tic anyway.

2014-05-10  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>

	* src/mouse.c (do_zoom rescale_around_mouse):  Handle various conditions
	that caused zooming around the current mouse position to fail.

2014-05-10  Shigeharu Takeno  <shige@iee.niit.ac.jp>

	* docs/gnuplot.doc: various small corrections
	* docs/gnuplot-ja.doc term-ja.diff:  Sync translation to version 1.887

2014-05-10  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/gd.trm: Do not allow setting terminal size to 0.  Bug #1398

2014-05-10  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* term/lua.trm: Ensure initialization of alpha.

	* src/hidden3d.c (store_polygon): Ensure initialization of v[],
	just in case somebody calls this function with an illegal
	'direction' enum value.

	* src/win/wgraph.c (PATTERN_BITMAP_LENGTH): Give name to magic number.
	(pattern_bitmaps): Use new name.

	* term/emf.trm (PATTERN_BITMAP_LENGTH): Give name to magic number.
	(pattern_bitmaps): Use new name and make const.
	(EMF_filled_polygon): Define pattern pointer more locally and make
	it point to const. Use named constant in loop.  Fix table
	underrun.

	* src/win/wgnuplib.c (GetInt): Add some parentheses.

	* src/stats.c (statsrequest): Initialize local data structs, to
	avoid warnings about printing uninitialized results.

	* src/readline.c (BACKSPACE): Define as a character constant, not
	some hex number.
	(readline): Write TAB as character constant, not some hex number.

	* src/interpol.c (gen_interp_frequency): Ensure initialization of
	y_total regardless of smooth type.

	* src/plot3d.c (grid_nongrid_data): Ensure initialization of
	numpoints.

	* src/pm3d.c (pm3d_plot): Ensure initialiation of gray.

	All the following concern the same problem: Macros from <ctype.h>
	cannot safely be called with arguments of type 'char' (because
	that may be signed).  Such values have to be cast to unsigned char
	on passing.

	* src/win/wtext.c (TextPutStr): See above.

	* term/post.trm (PS_load_fontfile): See above.

	* src/win/winmain.c (GetLanguageCode, open_printer): See above.

	* src/util.c (streq): See above.

	* src/term.c (enhanced_recursion): See above.

	* src/scanner.c (legal_identifier, scanner): See above.

	* src/readline.c (backspace): See above.

	* src/plot2d.c (store_label): See above.

	* src/internal.c (f_word): See above.

	* src/gplt_x11.c (exec_cmd): See above.

	* src/eval.c (set_gpval_axis_sth_double): See above.

	* src/datafile.c (df_readascii, plot_option_binary_format): See above.

	* src/command.c (changedir, expand_1level_macros): See above.

	* src/breaders.c (edf_findInHeader): See above.

2014-05-08  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>

	REVERT patch from 2014-04-26 because it broke normal zoom operations.
	* src/mouse.c (do_zoom rescale_around_mouse):  Handle various conditions
	that caused zooming around the current mouse position to fail.

2014-05-08  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.h (ACTUAL_STORE_WITH_LOG_AND_UPDATE_RANGE)
	src/plot2d.c (store2d_point) src/plot3d.c (get_3ddata)
	src/datafile.c (df_readascii) src/tabulate.c:
	Revised handling of NaN or Inf in the input data stream.  The program
	used to set type=undefined for this point but left all the data fields
	untouched (i.e. left them containing random garbage).  Version 5 fills
	in all data fields, including the one[s] containing NaN or Inf.
	This means that the output from "set table" matches the input data
	whereas before any line marked "u" contained garbage in the data fields.

	Note: For 3D data z=NaN or z=Inf is replaced by z=0.  This is needed to
	avoid problems with image data.  Possibly this special case should be
	handled in the image code itself rather than at the input stage.

	* src/plot2d.c (impulse_range_fiddling) src/plot3d.c: Don't extend
	range to zero for log-scaled axes.

2014-05-06  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/emf.trm: Custom dashtype support.

	* configure.in term/pdf.trm: Modify PDFlib terminal for use with 
	version 5 dashtypes (but no custom dashtype support).  Do not build
	by default.

2014-05-05  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/gp_types.h src/graphics.c (place_objects do_rectangle)
	src/misc.c (lp_parse) src/save.c (save_object) src/set.c (set_obj):
	Allow object borders to have a full set of line properties including
	dashtype.

	* docs/gnuplot.doc: Update documentation to better describe recent
	changes.

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp: Always use a solid line to draw
	point symbols, even if the current linetype has a dash pattern.

	* term/cairo.trm term/canvas.trm term/post.trm term/svg.trm term/wxt.trm
	term/x11.trm src/term.c:  Terminals that have been upgraded to version 5
	dash handling should ignore the "dashed/solid" terminal setting.

	* src/plot2d.c (impulse_range_fiddling) src/plot3d.c:  Autoscaled plots
	"with impulses" should include y=0 (z=0 in 3D) unless log-scaled.

2014-05-05  Tatsuro MATSUOKA <tmacchant3@yahoo.co.jp>

	* src/qtterminal/po/qtgnuplot_ja.ts: Update translations

2014-05-03  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/qtterminal/po/qtgnuplot_ja.ts: Update translations.

2014-05-01  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* config/mingw/Makefile (LDFLAGS2): Add auto-import flag.
	($(TARGET)): Add icon files and Makefile as dependencies.

	* config/config.mgw, config/config.cyg: The set of used /
	available configuration macros has changed across the past several
	years.

	* src/stdfn.h (sgn): Fix parenthesization of macro.
	(PATH_MAX): CLang compiler on Cygwin needs a silly little tweak.

	* src/graphics.c (samesign): Improve parenthesization a bit.

2014-05-01  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* demo/gantt.dem demo/html/*:  Add Gantt chart to demo collection.
	Add dashtypes to demo collection.

	* src/show.c:  Show "fixed" property of arrow style.

2014-04-29  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (f_timecolumn): Replace the old 1-parameter function
	timecolumn(col) with a 2-parameter timecolumn(col,"timeformat"). The
	old version had no way to handle time data that didn't correspond to
	a coordinate on a plot axis in time format (e.g. set xdata time).
	It would segfault if the function appeared in a using spec slot >= 2.
	Now we require an explicit format, so data input is dissociated from
	any particular axis or time setting.
	Bug #1394

	* src/gplt_x11.c term/x11.trm term/xlib.trm:
	Custom dashtype support for X11.

2014-04-28  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>

	* src/mouse.c src/mouse.h src/set.c src/show.c docs/gnuplot.doc:
	Remove the distinction between "coordinate format echoed to the screen
	during mousing" and "coordinate format saved to the clipboard on click".
	This removes the default bindings for hotkeys 3 and 4.

2014-04-28  Shigeharu Takeno  <shige@iee.niit.ac.jp>

	* docs/gnuplot-ja.doc term-ja.diff:  Sync translation to version 1.882
	* docs/gnuplot.doc: typos

2014-04-28  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c src/graph3d.c src/save.c src/show.c: Use named
	values LAYER_{BEHIND|BACK|FRONT} rather than magic numbers.

	* docs/gnuplot.doc: Add a section documenting the use of layers.

2014-04-27  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>

	* src/gplt_x11.c: Fix off-by-one error in selection string.
	Allow clipboard contents to be retrieved more than once.

2014-04-27  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c (plot_steps): Avoid overflow in clipping code.
	==> Reverted in favor of fixing the clipping code itself.

	* src/gadgets.c (clip_line): It is not safe to use (A*B >= 0) as a
	substitute for the test (sign(A) != sign(B)).
	It fails when A and B are integers and their product overflows.
	Bugs #1390, #1392	See also Bug #1358

	* src/stdfn.h: Define a sgn() function.

	* src/graphics.c: Use sgn() function to define samesign().

	* src/mouse.c: No longer need a local definition of sgn().

2014-04-26  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>

	* src/mouse.c (do_zoom rescale_around_mouse):  Handle various conditions
	that caused zooming around the current mouse position to fail.
	Bug #1380
	[REVERTED 2013-05-08 because it broke normal zoom]

2014-04-25  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/misc.c (lp_parse):  Disallow defining "set lt N lt M".
	This used to mean "define effective linetype N to be the hidden device
	specific linetype M", except that in other contexts it meant "use 
	effective linetype M rather than effective linetype N". Version 5
	distinguishes between color and dashpatten, so require an explicit 
	command to set one or both rather than an ambiguous old-style request.

	* src/save.c (save_pm3dcolor save_linetype):  Save special linetypes
	by keyword rather than a magic number (e.g. lt bgnd rather than -3).

2014-04-24  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/gp_types.h src/misc.c (lp_parse) src/misc.h src/plot2d.c
	src/plot3d.c src/set.c:  Revise the parameters passed to lp_parse() so
	that the legal options can vary depending on the identity of the caller.

	* src/term.c (test_term): Reset to default font after Bold/Italic test.
	Bug #1387

2014-04-24  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>

	* src/mouse.c (do_zoom_scroll_up):  Fix typo that causes incorrect
	manipulation of y2 axis scale during zoom.
	Bug (Patch #647)

2014-04-23  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/command.c src/graph3d.* src/set.c src/show.c src/save.c
	docs/gnuplot.doc:  Introduce a scale parameter "set view map {scale}"
	and set the default size of a plot in this mode to approximately the
	same as a default 2D plot.

	* src/command.c (replotrequest):  It's now OK to have a range in a
	replot command, since it can be applied to the new plot piece only.

	* src/datafile.c (df_readascii):  If a read request returns a string
	rather than a numerical value, nevertheless fill in the numerical 
	value as NaN.  This is better than leaving some random garbage there
	(in practice probably some earlier data value).
	Bugfix.

2014-04-21  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/canvas.trm: Support for custom dashtypes.

2014-04-20  Jérôme Lodewyck  <lodewyck@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/qtterminal/po/*.ts: Update translations.

	* src/qtterminal/qt_conversion.cpp: Add new encoding types.

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotEvent.* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotWindow.cpp
	src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp
	src/wxterminal/wxt_term.h term/qt.trm term/wxt.trm: new terminal option
	"position" that specifies the initial position of the plot window.
	Applies to Qt and wxt terminals. Feature request #386.

2014-04-19  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/command.c (test_command):  When "test" is issued before any plot
	command, suppress error messages if the window is resized.

	* term/PostScript/prologue.ps term/PostScript/prologues.h:
	Update PostScript prolog for version 5 and regenerate headers.

	* term/post.trm:
	Support for custom dashtypes in PostScript output.

2014-04-18  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/svg.trm (set_dashtype):  Fix potential buffer overrun;

	* src/misc.c (parse_dashtype):  A custom pattern must contain an even
	number of entries.

	* demo/dashtypes.dem demo/all.dem:  New dashtype demo.

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotEvent.h src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp
	src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp src/qtterminal/qt_term.h term/qt.trm:
	Support for custom dashtypes and dashlength in qt terminal.
	Change implementation of "lt nodraw" from background color to NoPen.

	* src/term.c (enhanced_recursion):  Consume only a single space following
	the font name in an enhanced text string "{/Fontname      text}".

	* docs/gnuplot.doc:  Initial documentation for `set dashtype` and
	dash properties in version 5.

2014-04-17  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/misc.c (parse_dashtype) src/save.c (save_dashtype) src/term_api.h
	src/term.c (term_apply_lp_properties) demo/dashcolor.dem: 
	Fix some glitches found while testing custom dashtypes.

	* src/term.c (test_term): Exercise bold/italic.  Longer line samples to
	make it easier to distinguish dashtypes.  Minor layout changes.

	* term/svg.trm:  Support for custom dashtypes.

	* src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.*
	src/wxterminal/wxt_term.h term/cairo.trm term/wxt.trm:
	Support for custom dashtype in all cairo-based terminals.

2014-04-14  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>

	* src/mouse.c (event_buttonpress):  Flip direction of horizontal 
	scrolling to match the convention used by vertical scrolling.

2014-04-14  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* configure.in (AC_FUNC_FSEEKO) src/datafile.h: LFS support part 2.
	If possible, use fseeko/ftello to navigate input data files.

2014-04-13  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_TYPES([off_t])) src/syscfg.h (#define off_t)
	src/binary.c src/datafile.c src/datafile.h:  Change the declared type
	of all variables contributing to calculation of file offsets from (int)
	to (off_t).  This is sufficient to allow seeking in files > 2GB on 64bit
	platforms.  It may also allow LFS support on some 32bit platforms if
	compiled with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 but in general it will also be
	necessary to replace fseek/ftell with fseeko/ftello (32bit linux) or
	_fseeki64/_ftelli64 (MSVC).

2014-04-11  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (df_binary_details[]): Handle int64 and uint64 types 
	even if current platform has sizeof(long) = 4.
	Bugfix

2014-04-08  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/save.c (save_linetype) src/misc.c (lp_parse)
	src/graphics.c (plot_lines) src/graph3d.c (do_3dplot plot3d_lines)
	src/boundary.c (do_key_sample):

	New linetype keyword "nodraw" maps to existing internal value LT_NODRAW.
	Apply this in the graphics layer rather than the terminal layer in order
	to distinguish between line properties and point properties.
	I.e. this draws blue points but no lines:
	  plot $FOO with linespoints lt nodraw pointtype 6 lc rgb "blue"

	* src/term.c (term_apply_lp_properties):  Distinguish between l_type
	values that really indicate a linetype (e.g. LT_NODRAW, LT_AXIS) and
	those which indicate a dash pattern. Send the former directly to
	term->linetype(). Send the latter to term->dashtype(), which may itself
	call term->linetype() if there is no private implementation of dashes.

2014-04-07  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term.c (null_dashtype):  Ignore custom dashtypes. Pass through
	dashtypes > 0 to term->linetype(). Treat negative dashtypes as LT_BLACK.
	This should allow terminals without a private dashtype implementation to
	continue working as they did before (pre-version 5).

	* src/plot2d.c (eval_plots):  Don't call lp_parse if all we want is
	a fill color.

	* src/boundary.c (do_key_sample) src/graphics.c (plot_boxes plot_c_bars):
	Funnel requests for linetype changes through term_apply_lp_properties().

	* demo/all.dem:  Add varcolor.dem to the test set.

2014-04-06  Christoph Bersch <usenet@bersch.net>

	* src/graphics.c (fill_between):  It is no longer necessary to clip in
	this routine because the component quadrilaterals will be clipped later.

2014-04-05  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/set.c (set_table): Name leak.

2014-04-05  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* demo/vector.dem docs/gnuplot.doc src/command.c src/datablock.c
	src/datablock.h src/gadgets.c src/gadgets.h src/plot2d.c src/set.c
	src/tabulate.c src/tabulate.h src/unset.c src/util.c src/util.h:
	'set table $datablock' redirects table output to a named data block.
	Patch #662

2014-04-04  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term.c (load_linetype):  If a line style is based on a lt < 0
	(LT_NODRAW, LT_BACKGROUND, LT_BLACK, etc), take only the line color.
	FIXME: LT_AXIS should also take the dash pattern but that mechanism
	isn't fully in place yet.
	Bug #1369

	* src/util.c (value_to_str):  Fix error in buffer length accounting.
	Bug #1372

	* src/alloc.c src/alloc.h src/bf_test.c: The conditional code in
	alloc.c for tracking memory allocation/free has bit-rotted to a point
	where the program segfaults on entry if it is enabled.  Since this sort
	of accounting is now better done using valgrind it is not worth fixing
	the old code.  Delete it.

	* src/alloc.c: Although freeing old help messages may free some memory,
	entangling the help system with every memory allocation seems excessive.
	If we're about to run out of memory there are deeper problems than old
	help messages.

	* configure.in: Remove EXPERIMENTAL warning from older options.

	* src/save.c src/set.c src/term.c:  Code style / whitespace cleanup

	* src/set.c (set_dashtype) src/misc.c (parse_dashtype):  Add comments.
	Truncate dashtype string to match size of stored pattern array.

2014-04-03  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/fit.h (error_ex):  Add noreturn attribute to avoid compiler
	warnings.

	* src/fit.c:  Correct test for invalid covariance matrix.

	* src/util.h (int_error, os_error, graph_error):  noreturn attribute
	for MSVC.

	* src/wgdiplus.cpp (drawgraph_gdiplus) src/win/wgraph.c (drawgraph):
	Test if command list is available.

	* src/win.trm (WIN_update_options) src/win/wmenu.c:  Incomplete format
	strings.

2014-04-02  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/misc.c demo/heatmaps.dem docs/gnuplot.doc:
	Document and add a demo for "with image pixels" (formerly "failsafe").

	* src/color.c src/plot3d.c src/pm3d.c src/pm3d.h src/save.c src/set.c
	src/show.c src/tables.c src/tables.h src/term.c src/unset.c:
	Revise "set pm3d hidden3d <lt>" to match other places where you can
	specify line properties.
	- Full syntax is now "set hidden3d {no}border {line-properties}"
	- Individual line properties can be overridden in the plot command
	- Old sytax is accepted as a synonym for "set hidden3d border lc <lt>"

	* demo/transparent_solids.dem docs/gnuplot.doc:
	Update documentation and demo to show new syntax

	* src/contour.c (end_crnt_cntr): Initialize blank label in new contour.

2014-04-01  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/command.c (test_palette_command):  Write the palette colors into
	a datablock $PALETTE rather than writing them as in-line data in a temp
	file.  Simplify the internal command sequence that generates the test
	output.  TODO: Move the command sequence into a datablock as well.

2014-03-30  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* term/caca.trm:  Change codepage from 932 to 437 on Japanese Windows.
	Apparently this fixes display problems, although libcaca uses unicode
	functions to write to screen.
	Bug #1361

	* src/eval.c src/internal.c|h src/parse.c:  Implement f_words instead
	of treating it as a special case in the parser.

	* src/command.c src/command.h src/plot.c src/stdfn.h src/syscfg.h
	src/win/wgraph.c src/win/winmain.c src/win/wprinter.c:  Include file

2014-03-29  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term.c (multiplot_current_panel) term/svg.trm src/term_api.h:

2014-03-24  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c (place_objects do_rectangle): When fillcolor for an

	in .../share.  The default sequence is visibly changed from the old
	red/green/blue ugliness, which should make users immediately aware that
	the colors can be customized.

	* src/set.c (set_linestyle):  Dash type of newly created linetype should
	by solid unless otherwise specified.

	* src/misc.c:  Allow `black` as a colorspec or linetype, analogous to
	`bgnd`.

	* src/parse.c (check_for_iteration next_iteration):
	Replace overly clever checks for end condition already satisfied with
	one that doesn't fail due to overflow of integer multiplication.
	Bug #1358

	* src/term.c (enhanced_recursion) term/post.trm(ENHPS_OPEN):
	The bold/italic support code has revealed a problem with PostScript
	output. The core code assumes that passing a blank font name means
	"keep the previous font" or at worst "use the default font". post.trm
	failed to do this for some command sequences. Fix it in two places.
	In term.c pass the previous font if we already know it.
	In post.trm fall back to the default rather than place a blank
	string in the ouput *.ps file.
	Bug #1359

2014-03-20  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/set.c src/term.c src/term_api.h src/util.c src/win/wgraph.c
	src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c term/aquaterm.trm term/pdf.trm term/post.trm
	term/pslatex.trm term/svg.trm:  Add support for codepage 1252, the
	standard Western European encoding on Windows.

	* src/set.c:  "set encoding locale" only handles utf8 and sjis. Extend
	this to all supported encodings on Windows, probably the only platform
	where this is still relevant.
	Bug #1270

	* demo/dashcolor.dem:  UTF-8 encoding.

	* src/fit.c (show_results):  Do not try to print parameter errors if
	the covariance matrix is unavailable or invalid.

2014-03-20  Thomas Henlich  <thenlich@users.sourceforge.net>

	* term/PostScript/cp1252.ps:  CP1252 encoding support for PostScript
	terminal. Based on Patch #341, but with non-standard characters
	removed.

2014-03-20  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/svg.trm:  svg was losing the current linetype (i.e. dash type)
	between drawing the key sample and drawing the main plot.

2014-03-19  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/stdfn.c src/stdfn.h src/internal.c src/win/winmain.c
	src/win/wtext.h config/config.nt:  Standard compliant replacements
	of snprintf() and vsnprintf() for MSVC.  Note that _snprintf does set
	errno=ERANGE if the destination buffer is too small.

2014-03-19  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/plot2d.c: Fix parsing error for "with lp pt 'X', ..."

	* src/boundary.c src/boundary.h src/graphics.c:  Refactor code that
	draws key samples for point plots.

	* configure.in term/gpic.trm src/term.h:
	Add configuration option --with-gpic

	* configure.in src/term.h:  FrameMaker now allows import of svg, so the
	utility of the ancient mif v3 support is dubious. Disable by default.
	Add configuration option --with-mif

	* demo/lines_arrows.dem demo/stringvar.dem demo/html/Makefile
	demo/html/index.* demo/html/webify.pl: Update demos for version 5.

2014-03-19  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/misc.c (parse_dashtype): Avoid warning about assignment used
	as a condition value.  Some reindentation.

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp
	src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotItems.h src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp:
	Implement image clipping for the Qt terminal.  Fix issue with
	unsigned variables in terminal coordinates.  Bug #1349

2014-03-18  Peter Juhasz  <juhaszp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/term.c src/set.c: Fix leaks and invalid reads associated
	with dashtype strings.

2014-03-18  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c:  PANGO_WEIGHT_NORMAL is not the same as 0.

	* term/x11.trm:  Make the "persist" flag local to x11 and remember
	what is was the last time we set the terminal to x11.
	Bug #1348

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotEvent.* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotWindow.cpp
	src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotWidget.cpp src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp:
	Block events that come from inactive plot widgets.

2014-03-17  Peter Juhasz  <juhaszp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/term_api.h src/misc.c src/misc.h src/save.c src/save.h:
	Parse and save dashtype specification in the form of "-_. " or 
	"(1.0, 0.3, 1.5, 2.0)". In the latter form alternating numbers 
	specify dash lengths and spaces between them.

	* src/gadgets.c src/gadgets.h:
	Added new type custom_dashtype_def and global variable 
	first_custom_dashtype in preparation of new "set dashtype" command.

	* src/gadgets.h src/misc.c src/set.c src/setshow.h src/show.c
	src/tables.c src/tables.h src/term_api.h src/unset.c:
	New commands 'set|show|unset dashtype <N> <dashtype_spec>' to
	specify permanent, user-defined dashtypes.

	* src/termp_api.h src/term.c src/misc.c: lp_parse() loads dashtype
	from the list of user-defined dashtypes if the absence of an explicit
	definition.

	src/misc.c src/plot2d.c src/set.c src/term_api.h docs/gnuplot.doc
	docs/plotstyles.gnu:
	New point type that consists of a single character (possibly a
	multibyte character).  This is particularly useful as
	    plot $FOO with linespoints pointtype "#" pointinterval -1
	where # is the desired character drawn at each point.

2014-03-16  Peter Juhasz  <juhaszp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/term_api.h src/term.c src/misc.c src/plot2d.c src/plot2d.c
	src/set.c src/save.c src/graphics.c src/gadgets.c src/gadgets.h:
	Introduce new "dashtype" line property that controls dot/dash 
	pattern independently. Allow it in "set|show linetype|linestyle",
	"plot", etc., display it in "save".
	Only numeric "dashtype N" supported for now. 
	New function dashtype() added to termentry struct, but none of the
	terminals use it yet.

	* src/set.c (set_linestyle): Set pm3d_color.type to TC_LT and
	pm3d_color.lt to line number by default. This is necessary because
	since the use_palette flag was removed, pm3d_color information is
	used everywhere, yet, it was not set properly. This resulted,
	among others, a broken "show linetype" output with empty "linecolor"
	spec.

2014-03-16  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/axis.h (en_minitics_status): Give enum a typedef name, too.
	(axis): Use new type for element of AXIS struct, instead of int.

	* src/axis.c (gen_tics): Simplify by using local OO-like "this"
	pointer variable.  Remove pointless local variable "minifreq".
	Treat "minitics" variable as a proper enum everywhere (no
	set/compare to zero).
