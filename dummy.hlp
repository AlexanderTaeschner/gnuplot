By default, GNUPLOT assumes that the independent variable is 'x' on
the 'plot' command line.  'x' is called the dummy variable because
it is just a notation to indicate the independent variable.  The
'set dummy' command changes this default dummy variable name.  For
example, you may find it more convenient to call the dummy variable
't' when plotting time functions:

        set dummy t
        plot sin(t), cos(t)

Syntax:
        set dummy <dummy-var>
        show dummy
