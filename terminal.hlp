GNUPLOT supports many different graphics devices.  Use the 'set
terminal' command to select the type of device for which GNUPLOT
will produce output. 

Syntax:
        set terminal {terminal-type}
        show terminal

If <terminal-type> is omitted, GNUPLOT will list the available
terminal types.  <terminal-type> may be abbreviated. 

Use 'set output' to redirect this output to a file or device.
