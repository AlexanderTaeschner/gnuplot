\title {\vspace{-.75in} \TeX-friendly gnuplot terminals \vspace{-5pt}}
\author{Ethan A Merritt - January 2022}
\date{}
\maketitle

This demo shows various options for combining gnuplot graphics with 
{\LaTeX} processing of text, usually to produce a figure that is to be
included in a larger {\LaTeX} document.
You have a choice among several \TeX-friendly gnuplot terminals.
Some of these ({\em pict2e}, {\em tikz}) hand off both the graphics
and the text to be processed by latex or pdflatex.
The {\em cairolatex} terminal uses the cairo graphics library to produce
a file containing the graphics in *.png, *.eps or *.pdf format and a
second parallel file *.tex containing the accompanying {\TeX} text elements.
The {\em pslatex} and {\em epslatex} terminals similarly create a pair of
files but the graphics file is limited to PostScript (*.ps or *.eps).

Although all of these choices use a {\TeX} or {\LaTeX} variant to process the
text component of the figure, the details vary.  For example,
some terminals optionally also use {\TeX} to draw individual point
symbols rather than treating them as graphics elements. Some
offer a similar option for treating arrows as {\TeX} elements rather
than as graphics.

Some terminals, notably {\em cairolatex} and {\em tikz}, offer a
"standalone" option to produce a self-contained {\LaTeX} document
rather than a fragment for inclusion in a larger document.

All of the figures shown here were produced with the same gnuplot code,
changing only the terminal type.  Here are the gnuplot commands

\begin{framed}
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
  # set title "It would be nice if this were converted into a caption!"
  set xtics 0.5 nomirror
  set tics format "%.1f"
  set margins -1,0,7,0
  set xrange [-1:1]
  set yrange [1:3]
  set key notitle invert under reverse Left left spacing 2 samplen 0.7
  set arrow 1 filled from graph 0.4, 0.7 to graph 0.6, 0.7
  set label 1 at graph 0.5, 0.75 "$k$" center
  Title_E = 'EllipticE$(k)=\int_0^{\pi/2} {\sqrt{1-k^2\sin^2\theta}}~d\theta$'
  Title_K = 'EllipticK$(k)=\int_0^{\pi/2} {\sqrt{1-k^2\sin^2\theta}~}^{-1}~d\theta$'
  
  plot EllipticE(x) lw 3 title Title_E,  EllipticK(x) lw 3 title Title_K
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{framed}

\noindent
Things to note
\begin{itemize}
\item{All text including plot titles is provided in {\TeX} syntax, not in
      gnuplot's own markup syntax. However formats as in the {\tt set tics}
      command are applied before output, so {\TeX} never sees the
      {\tt \%} character.}
\item{Even though we request the same font size and the same overall size
      for all terminals, it doesn't come out exactly that way.}
\item{All of the latex terminals, except maybe tikz, do a poor job of choosing
      the margins automatically.  It is a good idea to set them explicitly.}
\item{There is no way I know of to automatically transform the text from
      gnuplot {\tt set title "text"}
      into a corresponding latex {\tt \verb+\caption{text}+}.}
      The captions you see here were added explicitly in the outer
      latex\_demo.tex document.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{pict2e terminal}

This version of the figure is produced by the {\em pict2e} gnuplot terminal.
This terminal was created by Bastian MÃ¤rkisch based on the original gnuplot
{\em latex} terminal written by David Kotz and its successor terminals
{\em emtex}, {\em eepic}, and {\em tpic}.
The {\em pict2e} terminal requires standard latex support packages
{\em pict2e xcolor graphicx amssymb}.  To support transparent fill areas
when processed through pdflatex it also requires package {\em transparent}.
Both the graphics and the text are processed by latex, or in the case of this
demo by pdflatex or xelatex.

\begin{verbatim}
set terminal pict2e color texarrows font "cmr,10" size 3.5in,2.4in
\end{verbatim}
\gpinsetfigure{latex_pict2e}
              {Complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds}



\subsection*{cairolatex terminal}

The {\em cairolatex} terminal uses the cairo graphics library to produce
the graphical parts of the figure as a *.eps *.pdf or *.png file (your choice),
and it produces a parallel *.tex file so that latex (or pdflatex, xelatex, ...)
can combine the graphics and text into a single figure for later inclusion in a
latex document.  Generally you would use the {\tt eps} option only when working
in a plain latex/dvips environment that is limited to PostScript file inclusion,
and use the {\tt png} option only when the figure includes pixel-based images.

\begin{verbatim}
set terminal cairolatex color pdf font "cmr,10" fontscale 0.7 size 3.5in,2.4in
\end{verbatim}
\gpinsetfigure{latex_cairo}
              {Complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds}


\subsection*{tikz terminal}

The {\em tikz} terminal is the option I usually recommend.
It is simple to use although it is complex underneath, as the gnuplot
terminal driver interfaces with an external lua script to produce a *.tex file
containing both text and graphics commands for the PGF and TikZ {\TeX} packages.

\begin{verbatim}
set terminal tikz size 3.5in,2.4in
\end{verbatim}
\gpinsetfigure{latex_tikz}
              {Complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds}

By default it uses {\TeX} arrows, but uses gnuplot point symbols.
To see the many terminal options available, tell gnuplot {\tt set term tikz help}.
The options {\tt tex}, {\tt latex} and {\tt context} tailor the output for
a specific {\TeX} environment.  {\tt latex} is the default.
Load the corresponding style file at the beginning of your document:
\begin{verbatim}
   \input gnuplot-lua-tikz.tex    % (for plain TeX)
   \usepackage{gnuplot-lua-tikz}  % (for LaTeX)
   \usemodule[gnuplot-lua-tikz]   % (for ConTeXt)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{context terminal}

The {\tt context} terminal produces Metafun code for use by the 
ConTeXt macro package. Typically this terminal is selected as part of a stream
of gnuplot commands generated inside a ConTeXt session; the resulting output
is then fed back into that session.
For more information, see {\em ctan.org/pkg/context-gnuplot}.

\newpage

\subsection*{Other terminals: pstex epslatex pslatex}

The {\tt pstex}, {\tt epslatex}, and {\tt pslatex} terminals are perhaps
best viewed as serving a slightly different purpose.
Rather than aiding inclusion of gnuplot graphs in a {\LaTeX} document,
they are primarily intended to enable {\TeX}-set annotation of gnuplot graphs
included in a PostScript document.  The toolchain in this case is typically
{$ gnuplot \rightarrow latex \rightarrow dvips \rightarrow document.ps$}.

Nevertheless it is possible to use these terminals to create a standalone
*.eps file containing both graphics and already-rendered {\TeX} content,
and then include that *.eps file in a {\LaTeX} document using a
{\em {\verb+\includegraphics{}+}} statement as shown here.

\begin{verbatim}
set terminal epslatex color 10 size 3.5in,2.4in standalone
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics{latex_epslatex.eps}
\end{figure}


\subsection*{Legacy terminals}

Two older gnuplot terminals {\tt pstricks} and {\tt texdraw} remain in the
default build configuration.  They offer limited graphics capability
compared to the terminals described above.

Other older gnuplot terminals {\tt latex}, {\tt eepic}, {\tt emtex}, and {\tt tpic}
have been deprecated and are no longer included by default when gnuplot is built.
If necessary, the file {\em src/term.h} can be edited to uncomment {\em \#include}
statements for the corresponding terminal driver files prior to building gnuplot.

The {\tt metapost} and {\tt metafont} terminals have also been deprecated.
They can be including when building gnuplot by adding configuration options
{\tt --with-metapost --with-metafont}.
