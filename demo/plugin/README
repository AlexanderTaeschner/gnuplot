 How to build a dynamically loaded library from this source
 ----------------------------------------------------------

If you are configuringand building gnuplot from the top level of
the source tree then autoconf/automake will create a Makefile for
you and "make" should be sufficient.

If you are building _only_ this plugin demo, then under linux
a minimal build command is

    gcc -shared -lm -o demo_plugin.so demo_plugin.c

You should then be able to try the plugin demo using your
existing gnuplot executable and the newly-built plugin library.
