# Terminals that support polygon-fill can use this to draw
# points with background fill.
# Point types in the range 1001 - 1020 are reserved for this purpose.
# This is obviously terminal-dependent.
#
# As of now (may change) this is implemented for the qt, svg, postscript,
# and cairo terminals (includes wxt sixel kitty webp).
#	1001	background filled square

#	1005	background filled diamond
