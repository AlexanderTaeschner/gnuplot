For the impatient...

first, tune term.h to choose which terminal drivers you wish to enable.
If you want to support gif output, you need to download, compile and
install the gd library : see term/gif.trm for details.
If you want to support png output (free gif alternative), you need
png and z libraries : see term/png.trm for details.

on unix, use
% ./configure
% make

There are several options available for configure that you may want to change:

--prefix=/top/level/dir Specifies where to install gnuplot.  Two binaries are
			installed in prefix/bin and the gnuplot help is
			installed in prefix/lib.
--with-gnu-readline	Use the gnu readline library.  If you don't use this,
			you won't have file name completion.
--with-gnu-readline=/path/to/libreadline.a
			Use this form if your libreadline is not installedn
			where your linker can find it.
--with-cwdrc		When gnuplot starts up, check the current directory
			for a .gnuplotrc file.  This is normally disabled
			for security reasons.  (However, the home directory
			is always checked for a .gnuplotrc file.)
Do "configure --help" for more details.

On VMS, use buildvms.com if your make utility does not like makefile.vms
or descrip.mms

On other machines, look for a makefile that looks suitable,
(makefile.emx for emx on dos, makefile.nt for MS VC++ 4.x on NT and
probably win95, makefile.win for borland c on win95/nt, etc)


The GNUPLOT source code and executables may be copied and/or modified
freely as long as the copyright messages are left intact.

See the History file for changes to GNUPLOT.

Compilation instructions are near the end of this file.

GNUPLOT has been tested on Sun3's and Sun4's (SunOS 4.0.3 and 4.1.1),
a VAX 6410 (VMS 5.2), uVAX 3100 (5.4, 5.5, 6.0, 6.1) and AXP 3400 (1.5, 6.2)
Commodore Amiga's (KS/WB 1.3 and 2.0, SAS/C 6.2
and Aztec C beta 5.2a), IBM PC XT's and AT's (MS-DOS 3.3/5.0 BC++
3.1/TC++ 1.0 MSC 7.0, os/2), IRIS 4D/70G and 4D/25G with MIPS C, NeXT with
gnu C 1.34, DECStation 5000/200PXG (ULTRIX V4.1), AT&T 3B1 (version
3.51m with cc and gcc 1.39), and Apollo's (DomainOS SR10.3 BSD4.3
with C compiler 68K Rev 6.7(316)).  The code is written with
portability in mind.  GNUPLOT has not been tested on Pyramid 90x.

There is a mailing list for gnuplot users. Note, however, that the
newsgroup 
	comp.graphics.apps.gnuplot 
is identical to the mailing list (they both carry the same set of messages).
We prefer that you read the messages through that newsgroup, to subscribing
to the mailing list. (If you can read that newsgroup, and are already on the
mailing list, please send a message to majordomo@dartmouth.edu, asking to be
removed from the mailing list.)

The address for mailing to list members is
	   info-gnuplot@dartmouth.edu
and for mailing administrative requests is 
	   majordomo@dartmouth.edu
The mailing list for bug reports is 
	   bug-gnuplot@dartmouth.edu
The list of those interested in beta-test versions is
	   info-gnuplot-beta@dartmouth.edu

There is a daily digest of info-gnuplot available : ask majordomo
to subscribe to info-gnuplot-digest

Please tell us the version and machine on which your bug occurred.

 Also, please use meaningful email subjects, and particularly avoid
using a subject of 'help' to info-gnuplot since majordomo bounces
these to the list owner as suspected admin requests.




                       PREPROCESSOR #DEFINES

These #defines should be checked before compilation. There
are many makefiles provided as templates. You probably need these
only if porting to a new machine

These #defines are defined automatically by various compilers, some
gnuplot routines check these defines to implement features found in the
various environments:

define        note
------        --------
AMIGA_AC_5    defined for Manx Aztec C 5.2a on the Amiga
AMIGA_SC_6_1  defined for SAS/C 6.1 or later versions on the Amiga
apollo        defined by Apollo's C compilers.
_CRAY         defined by CRAY's C compiler.
__TURBOC__    defined automatically by  Borland C++ 3.x
unix          defined by most unix C compilers.
vms           (and VMS) defined by VAX-11 C under VMS.
__ZTC__       Zortech C compiler under MSDOS.
_Windows      defined by Borland C++ 3.0 compiling for MS-Windows


                             TO COMPILE

under UNIX:
To compile do:

  ./configure
  make

  
  The older, no-longer-preferred, way is to copy makefile.unx to Makefile
      cp makefile.unx Makefile
  Look through the Makefile to see if you need to make any changes.
  See especially the HELPDEST and TERMFLAGS variables.  Edit if needed.
  Alternatively, all these variables may be set as command line arguments to
  'make'. For example:

        make <MACHINE> HELPDEST='/usr/um/misc/lib/gnuplot.gih' \
                DEST='/usr/um/misc/bin' READLINE=

  Edit term.h, to include/exclude terminals
  Type
      make
  For further instructions.
  If that works, try
      make install
  For further instructions.

under VMS:
  To compile using DEC MMS or PD clone (MMK ?),
     invoke MMS or MMK with the supplied descrip.mms
  Or if you have a unix-like make utility
     copy makefile.vms makefile.
     make
  Or if you don't have a suitable make:
     @buildvms
  To tell gnuplot where to find the help library:
      $ define gnuplot$help disk:[directory]gnuplot.hlb
  Alternatively (and preferably) put the help in the main system help library.

under AmigaDOS:
Using Aztec C 5.2a
      make -f makefile.ami
Using SAS/C 6.1 or later versions
      smake -f makefile.amg

under TOS (Atari):
Using gcc 2.x as unix cross- or native compiler
	make -f makefile.st
(Edit top of makefile.st for name of crosscompiler or choose native setting)
Using PureC
	use gnuplot.prj
Using TurboC
	use gnuplot.prj
(Edit gnuplot.prj according to notes at the beginning)

Using Microsoft C 7.0 and compiling for MS-Windows
      copy makefile.msw makefile
      nmake
  Put wgnuplot.exe, wgnuplot.dll, wgnuplot.hlp and wgnuplot.mnu
  in the windows directory.

under MSDOS:
Using Microsoft C 7.0.
      copy makefile.msc makefile
      nmake 

Using Borland C++ 3.1 and compiling for MS-Windows
      copy makefile.win makefile
  Edit makefile to change TC.
      make
  Put wgnuplot.exe, wgnuplot.dll, wgnuplot.hlp and wgnuplot.mnu
  in the windows directory.

Using Borland C++ 3.0
      copy makefile.tc makefile
  Edit makefile to change TC, BIN, BGI, BGIOBJ. You may also want to turn
  off overlays (See manual for more on overlays).
      make


The file gnuplot.gih is needed for help on the PC.
If the file gnuplot.gih is not in the default directory, then use:
    set GNUHELP={full path name of gnuplot.gih}


                         ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

See 'help environment'.

If the environment variable GNUTERM is found, it is used as the terminal
type. Otherwise, in some cases the variable TERM will be used, or the
hardware may be automatically detected.

The PC version looks for the environment variable GNUPLOT to contain
the name of the directory from which to load the initialization file
GNUPLOT.INI.  See the help on 'start_up' for more information.

HOME is examined as a directory where a .gnuplot startup file might be
found. See help on "start-up".

If defined, the environment variable GNUHELP is used for the name
of the .gih help file, otherwise HELPFILE (defined in makefile or
plot.c) is used.

The VMS version looks for the logical name GNUPLOT$HELP to locate
the help library.

The CGI drivers need the CGIPATH environment variable to set the path
to the CGI agents, and the CGIDISP and/or CGIPRNT environment
variables to set the output devices.

The CGI drivers need the CGIPATH environment variable to set the path
to the CGI agents, and the CGIDISP and/or CGIPRNT environment
variables to set the output devices.

On solaris, if ld fails to run gnuplot_x11, you may need to
define LD_LIBRARY_PATH - see man ld for details.
