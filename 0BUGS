 1. The hidden line algorithm is not perfect.  We have put in an option
    to draw both sides of the surface in the same linetype, thus avoiding
    this problem completely.  We should put in an option of not drawing
    the back at all.

 2. The list of available devices is often longer than the length of
    a screen.  This output should be sent through a pager.

 3. In the Atari version, windows are not currently supported.  This
    means gnuplot 3.4 will not run with MultiAES.  We hope to correct
    this shortly in gpcontrb.tar.z.

 4. autoscale writeback is probably broken.  One problem is that
    the range is written back before the range is extented to a
    whole number of tics. eg  if data is 0.9->10.1, that is what
    gets written back, but the plot is 0 -> 11.  If autoscale
    is switched off, you do get 0.9->10.1 since switching off
    autoscale switches off the extend-to-tic-multiple stuff.

    Also, writeback with log scales writes back the log of the min/max

 5. system commands in a script file on VMS get truncated to the
    length of the last interactive command entered.  Workaround :
     load 'script.gnu'   # a long comment to pad the line

 6. "\n" does not work in the format for the tics in splot

 7. core dumps if key is manually placed in hidden3d splot

 8. Error bars don't work in polar plots

 9. clipping of arrrows and labels on 3D plots is broken

10. contour line clipping of 3D data plots
    The following tips for plotting contours were kindly supplied by Don Taber
    <dtaber@blackrat.risc.rockwell.com> and Paul Halsema <phalsema@harris.com>.

    Splotting gives little control over the appearance of contour lines.
    You can do a better job by extracting the contours with the table
    terminal and then plotting the resulting file.  You should 'set
    nosurface' to eliminate the surface isolines from the file generated
    by the table terminal.

    All the contours will be written to a single file.  To plot them with
    different line styles, you can use one of several approaches.  The
    simplest is to use the 'index' feature.  This has the advantage of
    using only gnuplot internals.  Other approaches use a utility
    such as sed, awk, or perl to either break up the file or generate
    a more sophisticated command file for plotting it.

    The following gnuplot script extracts circular contours from a
    paraboloid of revolution and plots the resulting file. It then
    uses 'index' to provide different linestyles.  Finally, it runs
    an awk script to generate a command file for plotting the file.

       set cntrparam levels discrete 20, 40, 60
       set contour base
       set nosurface
       splot x**2 + y**2
       set term table
       set output 'circles'
       replot
       set term linux  # or whatever your original term was
       set output

       plot 'circles'   # all one linestyle

       plot 'circles' index 0 t '20', 'circles' index 1 t '40', 'circles' index 2 t '60'  # different linestyles

       !awk -f contr.awk circles > circles.gnu
       load 'circles.gnu'

    Where the gawk script (contr.awk) contains the following:

#!/usr/bin/gawk -f
# courtesy of Paul Halsema (phalsema@harris.com)
BEGIN {
  print "set key out"
  print "set key title ","'"FILENAME"'"
  set data style lines
#Add any gnuplot commands that you always want performed here  
  printf "plot "
}
{
 if ($2=="Contour")
 {
  split($3,indx,",")
  titl=$5
  if ($3=="0,")
   {printf "'%s' \\\n     index %d title '%s'", FILENAME,indx[1], titl}
  if ($3!="0,")
   {printf ", \\\n  '' index %d title '%s'", indx[1], titl }
  }
}
END { print "" }

11. bug in pslatex driver
    Gnuplot put's it's PostScript code into `\special{..}' constructs
    which are directly handled over to the dvi to ps driver.  Unfortunely,
    TeX *does* expand so called `active characters' also inside the {} of
    a \special construct.  For instance the `german' package makes
    doublequotes active, which do appear in PostScript code.  Also line-end
    characters seem to be a problem, producing unwanted space in TeX's
    output sometimes.

    The following workaround was posted to de.comp.text.tex by Heiko
    Oberdiek <oberdiek@ruf.uni-freiburg.de>.  Use this LaTeX macro:

\makeatletter
\begingroup
  \catcode`\^^M=\active%
  \gdef\gp@newline{%
    \catcode`\^^M=\active%
    \let^^M=^^J%
  }%
\endgroup
\newcommand{\gnuplot}[1]{%
  \begingroup
    \let\gp@org@special\special
    \def\special{%
      \bgroup
      \@sanitize
      \gp@newline
      \gp@special
    }%
    \def\gp@special##1{\egroup\gp@org@special{##1}\ignorespaces}%
    % Remove unwanted spaces in horizontal mode in gnuplot file:
    \let\gp@org@endpicture\endpicture

\def\endpicture{\gp@org@endpicture\global\@ignoretrue\ignorespaces}%
    \let\gp@org@setlength\setlength
    \def\setlength##1##2{\gp@org@setlength{##1}{##2}\ignorespaces}%
    \input{#1}%
  \endgroup
}
\makeatother

   and load the file generated by gnuplot with \gnuplot{file} instead
   of \input{file}.

12. There is an initialization problem of when plotting time data with an
    interval calculation; an inordinate number of m[]tics are automatically
    drawn, e.g., 

       set xdata time; set ydata time
       set timefmt "%d/%m"
       set format x "%b %d"
       set xrange ["01/12":"06/12"]
       set xtics "01/12", 172800, "05/12"
       plot x

    The problem can be avoided by initializing via a plot before the 
    interval calculation:
       [...]
       set xrange ["01/12":"06/12"]
       plot x
       set xtics "01/12", 172800, "05/12"
       plot x


(Moved from old WhatsNew file, needs cleaning up)

BUGS outstanding
  illegal trailing tab on fig output
  minor tics missing on HPUX ?
  problem with time on os/2 - optimiser bug ?
  terminal settings get propagated when terminal is changed (now fixed ?)
  set ?range [] writeback is broken ? certainly for logscales.
  source file copyrights are out of date - what should go on new files ?
  to be documented - ms-windows cannot do wide, dashed lines (well, win32 can,
  but...)
  does not build on win16 or sun/cc (getting closer)

OTHER ISSUES
  set mapping spherical is not 'real' spherical polars
  terminals are no longer allowed to do their own scaling
  break up some of the drivers (eg epson and family) into their
    own files. *maybe* we can provide libraries of generic routines
    (particularly tex) which can be used by all interested drivers,
    and because they are a library, they are linked only if
    any relevant drivers are installed. bitmap.c could also be
    linked in this way.
  Now that all drivers are new format, do we need to explore separate
    compilation of the drivers into their own .obj files for DOS ?
  hidden line is SLOW, and throws up some logic errors
  have I got all os/2 and (in particular) mac changes ?
  filled boxes ?
  substitution using backquotes should not have a length limit
  the source indentation stinks - may I pass it through gnu indent,
     or will that mess up use of patches which did not make it into
     the release.
