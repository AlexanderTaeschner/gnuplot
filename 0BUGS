1. The hidden line algorithm is not perfect.  The back of the object
can bleed through to the front.  We should put in a option of not
drawing the back at all.

2. The list of available devices is often longer than the length of
a screen.  This output should be sent through a pager.

3. In the Atari version, windows are not currently supported.  This
means gnuplot 3.4 will not run with MultiAES.  We hope to correct
this shortly in gpcontrb.tar.z.

4. autoscale writeback is probably broken. One problem is that
 the range is written back before the range is extented to a
 whole number of tics. eg  if data is 0.9->10.1, that is what
 gets written back, but the plot is 0 -> 11. If autoscale
 is switched off, you do get 0.9->10.1 since switching off
 autoscale switches off the extend-to-tic-multiple stuff.

 Also, writeback with log scales writes back the log of the min/max

5. system commands in a script file on VMS get truncated to the
  length of the last interactive command entered. Workaround :
    load 'script.gnu'   # a long comment to pad the line

6. "\n" does not work in the format for the tics in splot

7. core dumps if key is manually placed in hidden3d splot

8. contour clipping

9. bug in pslatex driver
 Gnuplot put's it's PostScript code into `\special{..}' constructs
 which are directly handled over to the dvi to ps driver. Unfortunely,
 TeX *does* expand so called `active characters' also inside the {} of
 a \special construct. For instance the `german' package makes
 doublequotes active, which do appear in PostScript code. Also line-end
 characters seem to be a problem, producing unwanted space in TeX's
 output sometimes.

 The following workaround was posted to de.comp.text.tex by Heiko
 Oberdiek <oberdiek@ruf.uni-freiburg.de>. Use this LaTeX macro:

\makeatletter
\begingroup
  \catcode`\^^M=\active%
  \gdef\gp@newline{%
    \catcode`\^^M=\active%
    \let^^M=^^J%
  }%
\endgroup
\newcommand{\gnuplot}[1]{%
  \begingroup
    \let\gp@org@special\special
    \def\special{%
      \bgroup
      \@sanitize
      \gp@newline
      \gp@special
    }%
    \def\gp@special##1{\egroup\gp@org@special{##1}\ignorespaces}%
    % Remove unwanted spaces in horizontal mode in gnuplot file:
    \let\gp@org@endpicture\endpicture

\def\endpicture{\gp@org@endpicture\global\@ignoretrue\ignorespaces}%
    \let\gp@org@setlength\setlength
    \def\setlength##1##2{\gp@org@setlength{##1}{##2}\ignorespaces}%
    \input{#1}%
  \endgroup
}
\makeatother

 and load the file generated by gnuplot with \gnuplot{file} instead
 of \input{file}.
