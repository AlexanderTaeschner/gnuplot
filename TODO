[========================================================================]
[========= TODO BEFORE RELEASING VERSION 4.0 (EXCEPT BUG FIXES) =========]
[========================================================================]


COMMANDS:

-- add 'set view map' patch from sf (solves problems with "macro"-like
'set pm3d map' and correctly positions titles and labels for a map).
(Waiting --- does Hans-Bernhard or somebody else want to change anything
there?)

-- styles for arrow heads by Harald (it's a new feature, but works fine)?

-- pm3d doesn't work for concave data, concave in the sense of valid data
  per scan, where single scans are interrupted by invalid data points. (joze)
  * Petr: what do you mean? Example?

-- let 'binary' data files can have 4 columns to allow drawing textures
efficiently


DOCUMENTATION:

-- BUGS file should be updated.

-- gnuplot.doc should have sections "new in 3.7.1, 2, 3" and "new in 4.0";
the NEWS file could server as a basis.

-- Update in docs/old/*
Recently I've moved importants things from README.os2 into gnuplot.doc and
INSTALL; those other README.{x11, win, xli, nex} should be
dispersed similarly. Who can do it?

Also, README.{3d, pic, mf} should be edited into gnuplot.doc and removed.
Who has some knowledge about this?

I propose to keep those History and ChangeLog-like files in this directory
(or moved to src), maybe change them and concatenate them into single
ChangeLog / History file.

-- FAQ should be updated

-- update tutorial/

-- documentation for all X11 command line switches (joze)

TERMINALS:

-- see above about docs/old/README.*

-- pstricks? There is an old bug/patch request on sourceforge, can 
somebody comment on it?

-- windows terminal:
	-- rotated text is not supported
	-- colored text (textcolor.dem does not pass correctly)

-- Mac, Apple, MacOS support to be added

-- verify that terminals don't reset options (I've checked a lot, but 
should be tested again)

-- unify color and pointtype sequence, alias similar line and point type
sequences for the main terminal drivers (joze)

-- Also unify fill color sequence and fill pattern sequence;
   choose fill patterns to be optimal for monochrome output (EAM)

-- implement filledboxes for cgm


GNUPLOT LIBRARY:

Make a library (e.g. usr/local/gnuplot/scripts/, .../gnuplot/bin) of 
(a) gnuplot scripts, and (b) shell scripts relevant for gnuplot:

-- enclose script "gpsavediff" that diff's output of gnuplot's "save" command 
and default setup after "reset" 

-- move pm3d/contrib/* files into the proposed gnuplot library, then remove
pm3d/contrib and pm3d/ from cvs


WEB:

-- gnuplot needs a "professional" web page

VMS:

-- bring configure.vms in sync with current configure.in

Projects, in no particular order:

- revise border command to use keywords
- put minor tics into demo file

- define either quit or exit to mean finish-this-file, not finish session
  - at present, they are ignored in script files

longer term

- break it into four layers:
  : low level graphics  (some of term.c)
  : plotting code, reading the setshow.h global variables
  : parsing code - read a string, and parse and execute it
  : front end, interact with terminal / gui
  basically, gplotlib is layer 2, and the traditional gnuplot is
  layer 4, which is little more than a small client of layer 3.
  Terminal option lines are table driven,
  so that even though the options are defined by layer 1, the
  actual parsing is implemented in level 3

- group related 'set' variables into structures, particularly xaxis
  stuff,etc. This will allow a move to table-driven parsing.
  [PARTIALLY DONE] as of 3.8c
  [DONE for the axis ones] in 'axis' branch on SourceForge [HBB]

Lars' list

- much-requested feature: read text/commands from data files
- provide library of replacement functions instead of stdfn.c
- possibly switch to automake
  [PARTIALLY DONE] not done yet: docs lisp
  [docs is next; won't do lisp]
- completely rewrite the parser. Use yacc/bison if possible.
- maybe rewrite the scanner in lex? The benefits are not so obvious,
  because the current scanner is extremely simple. This is probably
  only worthwhile if the parser is rewritten at the same time.
- maybe use PD hash code for table-lookup (SNIPPETS code). Tables for
  builtin and user functions, variables, commands. What else? aliases
- [Robert S. Maier] rewrite term.c to provide an interface to GNU plotutils
- [HBB] rewrite hidden3d code 
  [MAINLY DONE] needs fine-tuning to remove single-pixel errors
- for post-3.7 release: integrate new feature patches (M. Koga's
  polygon patch, various postscript driver patches by Dick, T. Walter's
  gnuplot command line history save file, etc)? 
  All done except polygon patch. Better to use pm3d.
- standardise float/double comparisons around the suggestion in the
  comp.lang.c FAQ (What's a good way to check for "close enough"
  floating-point equality?) and symbolic constants from standard header files.
  LOADS of errors throughout the code, especially in graphics.c
- autogenerate term.h from config file in text format and/or configure?
- parse "~" in filenames as $HOME
  [PARTIALLY DONE] does not work for cd, set output
  [PARTIALLY DONE] works for all cmds now; plot key shows "~" instead
  of path (-> fix); does not accept "~" and "~user". Maybe implement
  former, latter requires reading passwd file (-> not!)
- general expansion of user defined and environment vars in
  labels?
- string variables, aliases
- [Lucas] fix axis ranges, overwritten labels in demos
- png driver needs update for png versions >=0.95
  must be backwards compatible (do we want to require png >=0.95? We
  already require >=0.89; possible compile problems under Irix 6.x which
  comes with png 0.88/zlib 1.0)
- write or organise a portable version of snprintf(3) with a copyright
  compatible with the gnuplot copyright (ie. no GPL) (Apache?)
- gnuplot often doesn't free() memory; rearrange code to do this
  [memdump() function, command; mem_cleanup(), to be called on
   exit and reset; check existing code]
- add Amiga WinGnuplot driver and related files (difficult; cannot get
  it to run successfully when compiled with gcc)
- add more maintainer checks (eg. file permissions)
- better lisp/ files integration (Makefile target to import Bruce's
  latest version). How to handle duplicates?
- better documentation format; get rid of the doc2xxx utils
  [SGML. SGML. SGML]
- update the FAQ!!!!
  [Being worked on by Juergen]
  updated version now in archive
- non-integer time value in 'pause' command
  implement using select() where available, or usleep(); round off
  on systems without
- tilde and variable expansion to be done by 
  gp_fopen() - to be implemented
- fix bug which prints "DI,1DI,0" in the upper left corner of the plot when
  in pcl5 mode and printing to an HP Laserjet 4+ (J. Breeding, bug-gnuplot)
  [HBB: reason known, but proper workaround path unclear]
DONE - integrate gpltconv into gnuplot (convert command?), configure option
DONE - make history size configurable (set historysize)
DONE - port writeback fix to 3.8

HBB:
WIN16 compile (BC++3.1):
DONE - no vfprintf simulation for the WText module, yet --> int_error problematic
-- graphics.c: too much global data?

WIN32 compile (BC++4.52):
DONE - problems with the 16bit helper programs doc2help, bf_test (local installation problem suspected)
-- test run fails: script execution stops as soon as first plot is done.

Petr Mikulik (info-gnuplot-beta Thu, 02 Mar 2000)
it would be very convenient to set the values/formulae for columns in 
advance, before "plot" --- something like
        set data using 3:($8/$9+1)
