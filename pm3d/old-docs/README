Here you find a release of patches for gnuplot's new pm3d splot 
mode.


Files:
------

README		this file
README-pm3d	some doc for pm3d (e-mailed to info-gnuplot mail list)
README-termentry some doc for new terminal entries (e-mailed to info-gnuplot mail list)

gp3708b-pm3d.diff pm3d patch for gnuplot 3.7 pl 0.8, pm3d version (b)
color.h		new file for pm3d things
color.c		"
pm3d.h		"
pm3d.c		"

pm3dCompress.awk script to shorten postscript files with pm3d splot and regular
		(grided) data

ApplyPM3D.cmd	my OS/2 script to apply all patches
ApplyPM3D.sh	my shell script "

demo-pm3d/*	demo for pm3d, see README therein


Compiling:
----------

The patch must be applied after the mouse patches for PM terminal. If not, 
then you can find some patches to be rejected; however, the rejects effect 
only the OS/2 code, so don't care on other platforms. 

Files color.h, color.c, pm3d.h, pm3d.c have to be copied to src/

Compiling gnuplot+pm3d on OS/2, you may use my script ApplyPM3D.cmd
On Unix, see ApplyPM3D.sh.


Snapshots:
----------
Please look first look at http://www.sci.muni.cz/~mikulik/gnuplot.html
or something like that for the snapshot of this new splot functionality.

Notes:
------
README-pm3d and README-termentry enclosed here close are those from 
14. 3. 1999, thus NOT updated for new things developed, like `fig` terminal
support. But both are surely useful anyway.


History of public releases:
---------------------------
 15. 6. 1999 update: splitting `set pm3d` and `set palette`
  1. 5. 1999 update: some improvements, `set pm3d map`, demo
 22. 4. 1999 update: fig terminal; formulae 30,31,32; ps: /Color; pm3dCompress
 15. 4. 1999 update: (help) set/show pm3d + several new options
  6. 4. 1999 (gp 3.7 pl 0.5);
