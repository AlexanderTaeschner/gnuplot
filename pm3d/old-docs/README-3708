Subj: pm3d mode for gnuplot 3.7.0.8

I have updated pm3d for gnuplot 3.7.0.8. It is available at 
  http://www.sci.muni.cz/~mikulik/gnuplot/

Changes:  splitting of `set pm3d` to `set pm3d` and `set palette` so that
colour palettes can be later used for pm3d, filled colour contours or
polygons, colour histograms, colour gradient background, and whatever it is
or it will be implemented...

New: `set palette`
	`show palette`
	`show palette palette <n>`

According to the feedback from other users, the following features
are highly requested:
(*) X11 terminal support (could be coded according to pm.trm / gclient.c)
(*) PNG terminal support (could be coded according to gif.trm)
(*) colour box positioning

Are there some skilled programmers to implement the above features? 
(I cannot do this myself).
