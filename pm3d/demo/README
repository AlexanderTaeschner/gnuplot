	- Linux VGA
	- GGI
	- Windows

  Makes one postscript file with all demo pictures.
  Use ghostview for previewing

Demo-Gif-pmview.gp
  gif output, preview by `pmview` program (shareware for OS/2, Win). 
  Edit yourself if you prefer another program (i.e. pmjpeg, explore -q)

Demo-Gif-xv.gp
  gif output, preview by `xv` for X11. 
  This script equals to Demo-Gif-pmview.gp with `pmview` changed to `xv`
  
Demo-Gif-xv-pipe.gp
  Similar to above, but data are piped into xv without any temporary file


Note: Xfig demo is not available, try this yourself.
