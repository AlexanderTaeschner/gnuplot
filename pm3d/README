pm3d: new splot mode for gray/colour maps and surfaces, and much more.

Here a new type of splot mode:  pm3d.  This adds the possibility to draw 
colour/gray maps and surfaces (even without preprocessing!) in addition to 
contours and wired surfaces currently supported. Please look at some 
snapshots of the new functionality at
	- http://www.sci.muni.cz/~mikulik/gnuplot.html
	- http://www.zellner.org/gnuplot

Current (development) gnuplot-mouse-pm3d sources are available from 
the gnuplot CVS tree, branch pm3d, at SourceForge:
  [export | set | setenv] CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gnuplot.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gnuplot
  cvs login
  cvs -z3 checkout -P -r pm3d gnuplot

You may download precompiled OS/2 binaries from
        http://www.sci.muni.cz/~mikulik/gnuplot/

pm3d mode works on terminals capable of filled colour polygons. Currently 
supported terminals are:
	OS/2 Presentation Manager
	X11
	Linux VGA
	GGI
	Win
	PostScript
	pslatex, pstex, epslatex
	GIF
	Fig
	tgif
	pdf

You are welcome to run pm3d demo.
Please use "help set pm3d" and "help set palette" for further information.
