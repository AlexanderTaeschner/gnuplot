The content of this subdirectory is mostly of historical interest.
It is not included in gnuplot distribution packages.

The basic pm3d code was merged into gnuplot long ago.
The scripts in this collection were written to clean up, simplify,
or add color features to PostScript files produced by gnuplot+pm3d.
These capabilities are now supported directly in gnuplot,
and are not limited to PostScript output.

Subdirectories:
    contrib/scripts - contributions using pm3d (colour points, 
		      compress pm3d postscript file, ...);
		      see README therein

Note: other useful gnuplot scripts can be found on gnuplot.sourceforge.net.
