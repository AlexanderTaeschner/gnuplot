This directory contains files that are useful for the epslatex terminal.
The file 'gnuplot.cfg' is loaded by epslatex plots in 'standalone' mode
if in the LaTeX search path.  Feel free to edit 'gnuplot.cfg' and put it
somewhere into the LaTeX search path (normally,
'$TEXMFLOCAL/tex/latex/gnuplot', '$TEXMFHOME/tex/latex/gnuplot', or the
current working directory).  If your LaTeX distribution contains the 
programme 'kpsexpand', the Makefile installes 'gnuplot.cfg' into 
'$TEXMFLOCAL/tex/latex/gnuplot' and updates LaTeX's file database.
