This command saves either user-defined functions, variables, or both
to the specified file. 

Syntax:
        save  {option} <filename>

Where <option> is either 'functions' or 'variables'.  If no option is
used GNUPLOT saves both functions and variables. 

'save'd files are written in text format and may be read by the 'load'
command.

The filename must be enclosed in quotes.

Examples:

        save "work.gnu"
        save functions 'func.dat'
        save var 'var.dat'
