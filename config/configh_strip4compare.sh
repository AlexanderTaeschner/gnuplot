# Description:
# This script is a part of gnuplot. From config.{?|??|???} files it
# creates new files config.xxx.new with stripped definitions so they can
# be compared easily via diff, kdiff3, kompare etc.
#
# Use:
# You should copy ./configure'd config.h and an investigated config/config.???
# into an empty directory and run this script there. Then, compare the
# *.new files with config.h.new, and synchronize the differences.

AWKPROG='
# In #define XXX, #undef XXX, /* #define XXX ... */ and /* #undef XXX */
# lines of gnuplot config.aaa, replace them by  #def XXX.
# That makes it easy to compare two different config files, to check for
# potential inconsistencies.
