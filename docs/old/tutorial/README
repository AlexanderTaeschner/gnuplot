This tutorial covered obsolete latex terminal variants that were
deprecated and are no longer in the gnuplot distribution package.
So the tutorial is obsolete and anyhow cannot be built from the
current gnuplot source because the terminal drivers are gone.

The functional replacement for the old tutorial is the demo
subdirectory:   "make latex_demo"
Source:
    	$top_srcdir/demo/latex_demo.tex
