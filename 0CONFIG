***TEST FEATURE *******
This release of gnuplot contains test "configure" scripts.  These have
not been fully tested.  We strongly recommend that you try to use
the makefile corresponding to your system first.


*** On Unix, you can use the GNU-style "configure" script and ignore
the complex instructions below.  Besides the standard GNU configure
options, this one accepts:
--with-no-readline to disable fancy command-line editing
--with-cwdrc to read a .gnuplot file in the current directory
  (security hole)
--with-lasergnu to install the "lasergnu" shell script for printng a plot
See Makefile.in for further comments on options.
*** There are some things the configure script doesn't know how to
detect yet; see the FIXME lines in configure.in.  If you figure out
how to fix one of them, please send mail to djm@gnu.ai.mit.edu and
bug-gnuplot@dartmouth.edu telling how.
