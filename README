gnut2p translator - David Kotz January 1990

This program converts gnutex files to gnuplot files.  It does its
best, but is not perfect. Most of gnutex will translate directly, some
things will translated easily (such as 'set size'), but some things
cannot be translated (such as 'set style'). One thing this program
does is to move plot commands down past the 'label' and 'key' commands
(which change into 'set label' and 'set key' commands). This may move
it past other commands. If it moves past variable or function
definitions, 'set' commands, or other commands which affect the plot
command's execution, then the new version will be incorrect. I expect
this case to be rare; indeed, I generally expect the last lines in
GnuTeX input files used with LaTeX to consist of 'plot, label,' and
'key' commands.

The usage of this program is simple: 

   gnut2p infile outfile

'infile' is an existing GnuTeX file, and 'outfile' will be created as
the GNUPLOT equivalent. The errors, warnings, and explanatory comments
appear on stderr. Any use of line continuation will be lost, and some
instances of the input style (eg, white space) may be changed.

To build this program, see the Makefile. It is fairly straightforward.
