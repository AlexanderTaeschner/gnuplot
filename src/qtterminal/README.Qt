The Gnuplot Qt terminal comprises the following components:

- QtGnuplotApplication : a QApplication that manages Gnuplot windows
- QtGnuplotWindow      : a QMainWindow that embeds a tool bar, a status bar
                         and a Gnuplot widget
- QtGnuplotWidget      : a QWidget comprising a QGraphicsView that displays
                         a plot rendered by a QGraphicsScene
- QtGnuplotScene       : a QGraphicsScene that does the actual rendering
- QtGnupotItem         : most of the plot is rendered using standard items,
                         except for points and enhanced text which have their
                         custom items

qt_term.cpp defines the interface between Gnuplot and the GUI. It starts the
QApplication in a separate process and communicates with it through a QLocalSocket
