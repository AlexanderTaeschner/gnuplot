The sampling rate of functions may be changed by the 'set samples'
command.  By default, sampling is set to 160 points.  A higher
sampling rate will produce more accurate plots, but will take
longer.  In generating plots, GNUPLOT will use either the sampling
rate set or the resolution of the current output device, whichever
is lower. 

Syntax:
        set samples <expression>
        show samples
