README               this file
ChangeLog            a log of changes by version number
gnuplot.el	     gnuplot mode for emacs
info-look.20.2.el    programmer's interface to info files, old version
info-look.20.3.el    programmer's interface to info files, new version
gnuplot-gui.el       a GUI for setting command arguments interactively
dot.el               a short lisp file used by the Makefile
gnuplot.info	     info version of gnuplot 3.6 help
gpelcard.tex         quick reference card for gnuplot mode (latex)
        .ps                                                (postscript)
Makefile	     a simple makefile for compiling the lisp and latex
dotemacs             example .emacs lines for enabling gnuplot mode



			     Installation
			     ============

1.  Unpack the gnuplot.tar.gz and cd to the gnuplot directory.  

2.  Run "make".  If you use XEmacs, run "make EMACS=xemacs".

3.  Move the .elc files to a place where emacs can find them, for
    example /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp or your personal emacs
    directory.

4.  Insert the contents of the `dotemacs' file into your .emacs file
    or system start-up file to enable gnuplot mode.

5.  The function `gnuplot-info-lookup-symbol' looks at the Gnuplot
    info file that comes with this package or that can be made from
    the Gnuplot distribution.  For that function to work, the file
    gnuplot.info must be placed somewhere where info can find it, for
    example /usr/info.  A line like this in your .emacs allows you to
    put gnuplot.info any place convenient:
     (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "/path/to/file")


Wouldn't it be //great// if Emacs had some kind of interactive package
installing facility?  I think so, too!  Oh well....



				NOTES
				=====

1. There used to be an installation script written in perl.  I am no
   longer distributing it. 

2. If you do not have the custom library installed, you will get
   several harmless warnings when compiling gnuplot.el.  Gnuplot-mode
   will work even without the custom library installed.

3. The file info-look.el provides the on-line help functionality.
   Using a tool that is a standard part of Emacs is a good idea, but
   this one gets complicated.  This file became part of Emacs with
   version 20.  It changed between 20.2 and 20.3.  And it does not
   come with XEmacs.  What's more, the version from 20.2 has a bug and
   the newer version does not work with Emacs 19.  So, this
   distribution comes with two versions of info-look.el, the version
   from Emacs 20.2 patched to work correctly and the version from
   Emacs 20.3.  Here's what happens when you run make:

   a.  If you use Emacs 19 or XEmacs 19, then the Makefile will
       compile the 20.2 version.
   b.  If you use Emacs 20.2 or lower, the Makefile will compile the
       20.2 version.
   c.  If you use XEmacs 20 or higher, the Makefile will compile the
       20.3 version.
   d.  If you use Emacs 20.3 or higher, the Makefile won't compile any
       version.

4. The gnuplot-mode distribution comes with a new version of the
   gnuplot info file.  Use it rather than the old one.  If you
   really must use the older info file, see the document string for
   the variable `gnuplot-info-hook'.

5. Some of the functionality of gnuplot-mode requires files other than
   gnuplot.el.  Care has been taken in gnuplot-mode so that it will
   continue to function sensibly if any of these pieces are missing.

6. The interactive graphical graphical interface to setting command
   arguments contained in gnuplot-gui.el is experimental.  It is
   incomplete and may make mistakes.  Specifically, it does not
   support arguments for "plot", "splot", "fit", "cntrparam", or
   "hidden3d" and it does not know how to parse or set comma separated
   position arguments such as those used to specify arrow or label
   locations.  It handles all other commands and knows about many
   terminal types.  Hopefully, you will find it useful.  It *requires*
   that you are using a version of emacs with the widget library
   installed or that you have installed it yourself.  Version numbers
   in the 20's of Emacs and XEmacs ship with the widget library.  For
   version numbers in the 19's, it can be obtained at
   http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/
