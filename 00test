This is the umpteenth test version for gnuplot release 3.6

For a list of changes please refer to the RCS log in version.c, the log in
makefile.r is no longer up to date. See also WhatsNew


I have started a file CodeStyle, which lists things that have to be observed
to keep the code protable. I will also try to suggest a common style for
identation etc, maybe we can run the files through indent immediatly before
release of the final version.


If you have any additions to the program (and I guess there are a couple),
please send them, as usual, to bug-gnuplot@dartmouth.edu.

If you want to send any comments to me, I can be reached as
denholm@conmat.phys.soton.ac.uk
You can also place submissions
in ftp://cmpc1.phys.soton.ac.uk/incoming
Please also email me to let me know what's there - I'm not in the habit
of looking there.

However, submissions to bug-gnuplot are prefered, since other developers can
comment on additions before they get included.

David Denholm
