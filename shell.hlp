The 'shell' command spawns an interactive shell.  To return to
GNUPLOT, type 'logout' if using VMS, 'exit' or your END-OF-FILE
character if using Unix, or 'exit' if using MS-DOS. 

A single shell command may be spawned by preceding it with the !
character ($ if using VMS) at the beginning of a command line.
Control will return immediately to GNUPLOT after this command is
executed.  For example,

     ! dir

prints a directory listing and then returns to GNUPLOT.
